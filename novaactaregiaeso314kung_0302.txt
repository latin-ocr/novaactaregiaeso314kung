each of a double crystalline cone, very long, evenly increasing in thick-
ness from the narrowly pointed base to the apex where the Semperi'an
nucleus is distinct; the basal part being surrounded by the ocular pigment.
The two halves of the cone are often separated from one another for a
considerable part of their length. The cuticular cornea is distinctly facetted;

these facets being‚‘ in my opinion, nothing else but an enlarged hexa-
gonal reticulation such as that which I have mentioned above as occur-
ring in the integument of the body. The number of ocelli and their size
vary much from one species to another, and will be recorded below
in the specific descriptione.

5. The first pair of antennoe.

In the male the shape of the first pair of antennae essentially
agrees with that in the other families belonging to the subtribe Hy-
periz'dea em‘vioomia. The peduncle is three-jointed⁷ but very often the
second or third joint is indistinct. The first joint of the flagellum,
regarded as the third joint of the peduncle by some authors, is enor-
mously developed‚ much longer and stouter than the peduncle⁷ curved‚
and bent downwards almost rectangular to the peduncle (fig. 18); the hind
convex side is thickly covered with long cylindrical, olfactory hairs⁷ set
in regular, transversal rows, each hair being fixed on a small butten-like ele-
vation. The under side of the first joint is truncated and long, the lower
anterior corner often being produced into a thick, obtuse process. The sides
of this enlarged first joint of the flagellum often show numerous soft
tubercles and small grooves7 probably containing cutaneous glands (fig. 19).
