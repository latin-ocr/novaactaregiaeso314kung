Diayn. The lzead is about as long as the whole peraeon and the first
pleonal segment together.

The first pair of pet-wopocla are subcheliform3 the under free
margin of the carpus is as long as the hind margin of the
metacarpus3 the lower part of the hind margin of the carpus
is provided with seven or eight teeth, some of them double-
pointed. The second pair are subcheliform⁷ with the lower
hind corner of the carpus a little produced; the carpal pro-
cess is strongly serrated on the frent margin, and provided
With three long sharp teeth on the hind margin just above
the apex,- the front margin of the carpal process is quite as
long as the hind margin of the metacarpus. The femur of
the seventh pair is fully half as long as that of the sixth‚
a little longer than broad7 and twice as long as all the
following joints together.

The lateral parts of the first two pleonal segments are angular
behind; the hind corner os the third segment is produced
into a triangular, sharp-pointed process, reaching beyond
the middle of the first ural segment.

The inner ramus of the second pair of uropoda is only a
trifle longer than the onter3 the inner ramus of the third
pair is twice as long as the peduncle, and more than twice
as long as the outer ramus.

If the above diagnosis be compared with that of Dorycephasus
ambobus, which follows, it at once will be seen that only small and trifling
characteristics can be given for the distinction of the two species, andI
am much inclined to think that the latter ought to be considered as a
Pacific variety of the former. The closer discription of D. Lindstroemi
will support the view that the two species are very nearly allied; but as
Ι have myself examined specimens of D. ambobus, and asall the cha-
racteristics indicated by STEBBING are exactly the same as in my speci-
