Theeli.

Α. The lower hind corner of the pleonal segments is pro-
duced backwards, and sharp—pointed.

a 1, The last ural segment is as long as the telson. Thc
rostrum is longer than the rest of the head (ἆ).
The scveuth pair of pcraeopmla are shorter than
the femur of ‘the sixth pair l. S. sclerotiea·

a 2. The last ural segment is more than twice as long
as the telson. The rostrum is much shortcr than
the rest of the head (0¹). The seventh pair of peraeo-
poda are much longer than the femur of the

sixth pair. 2. S. typhoi'des.
ι

Β. The lower hind corner of the plconal segments is squar-
ed, not produced, nor sharp-pcinted. The last ura] seg-
ment is about a fourth part longer than the telson.
The rostrum is nearly as long as the rest of the head (ὅ).
The seventh pair of peraeopoda are longer thau the

Diayn. The body is dorsally carinated, with a broad, rounded ridge‚ ἢ
and a row of nodules along the sides above the epimerals.
The fifth epimeral has a prominent spine directed baokwards;
the whole surface of the body is finely granulated.

The head is as long as the first five peraeonal segments to-
gether; the rostrum is considerably longer than the rest of
the head, and is wedge-shaped.

The first four join‘ss of the second pair of antennae are
subequal in length and straight3 they reach, when folded‚
