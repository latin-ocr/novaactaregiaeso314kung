X1PHOCEPHALUS LILLJEBORGI. 131

The urus is about as long as the whole pleou; in the female it
is a little longer; the first ural segment is about as long as, or longer
than, the last coalesoed segmen‘t. Both seg-ments are serrated 011 the
under side.

The first pair of ‘ecropoda (Pl. VII, fig. 18) are about as long
as the last pair, and roaoh fully to the middle of that pair3 the first
pair are less than a third part longer than the second pair, and have
the inner ramus only a lit-tle longer than the outer. The second pair
(p. 40, fig. 78) reach beyond the apex of the last coalesced ural segment,
and have the outer ramus only a little shorter than the inner. -The
third pair (p. 40, fig. 79> are distinotly shorter than the telsmr, and
have the outer ramus somewhat more than half as long as the infler
(p. 40, fig. 81).

The telson (p. 40, fig. 82) is sharp-pointed, and sometimes obli-
quely bent at the apex; it is considerably shorter than the urus.

Diayn. The lzeacl, without the rostrum, is a little longer than the
first five peraeonal segments. The neck is scarcely longer
than the ocular region. The rostrum is fully as long as the
peraeon and pleon together.

The seventh peroemzal segment is more than half as long as
the sixth3 the hind corner of the epimeral is somewhat
produced downwards‚ and is obtuse at the apex.

The epimeral of the first pair of perseopoda is obtusely tri-
angular. The oarpal process of the first pair is armed with
two small teeth 01] the hind margin3 the lower hind corner
of the metacarpus is rounded. The femur of the fifth and
sixth pairs is narrow, not dilated.

The pleon is dorsally smooth‚ not carinated.

The first ural segment is as long as the last coalesced
segment. ,

The first pair of w'opocla are considerably longer than the
third, the second pair are much longer than the last coalesced
