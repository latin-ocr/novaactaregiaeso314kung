independent species, or identical with O. piscator, is a question, Which
I am not yet able to answer definitively, but Iam much inclined to think
that the two are identical, as practically there are no differences to be
found in the description of STREE'rs.

The head is somewhat longer and more depressed in the male
than in the female, in which the ocular region is tuniid and rises con-
siderably above the dorsa] line of the peraeon, a feature which seems
to occur, in a smaller or higher degree, in all the female forms in the
family, and which may thus be looked upon as a sexual distinction. In
the male the head is as long as the six first peraeonal segments together,
in the female as long as the first five. The rostrum is scarcely half
as long as the rest of the head.

The first pair of antenna> in the male are comparatively slender;
the first joint of the flagellum is about four times as long as it is broad
at the apex; the three following joints together are longer than the breadth
of the first flagellar joint.

The perceon shows a very feeble median keel dorsally, and an al-
most evanescent lateral ridge on each side in the fully adult animal, in
the younger state the peraeon is perfectly smooth.

The epiwnerals are long and deep, fully a third part as deep as
the height of the peraeon.

The first pair of perceopoda (Pl. I, fig. ll) are much shorter.
than the second; the lower front corner of the carpus is a little protrud-
ing, but does not form a distinct heel as in the following species3 the
carpal process is irregularly serrated, with broad teeth, and bordered by
very long, stout bristles3 it is somewhat longer than the hind margin
of 'the metacarpus, which forms a thin serrated edge, with short trian-
gular teeth (Pl. I, fig. 12); against the rounded lower corner of this
edge the dactylus impinges, so that the first pair really have a com-
plexely cheliform hand (see above, p, 33). The second pair (Pl.I, fig.
13) have a very long cheliform hand, the carpus, without the process, being
half as long again as the metacarpus; the front margin of the carpus
runs in a line with that of the metacarpus, the lower corner not pro-
truding at all3 the carpal process is serrated, bordered with a few short
bristles, and is considerably longer than the hind margin of the meta-
carpus. but does not reach to the apex of the dactylus. The third and fourth
pairs are equal in length and slender; along the hind margin of the
tibia and carpus there are some short spines. The fifth pair are the
longest; the femur is almost ovate, and as long as the three following
