STREETS, when iustituting the new genus Leptocotis(·24‚ p. 137)
observed that it »exhibits 3 remarkable blending of the characters 01039-
eeplzalus and thabdosoma». The characteristic which most suggests affinity
with Xiphocephalidae is undoubtedly the narrowly elongated form of the
1381 11131 segment, of the peduncles of the uropoda⁷ and of the 1018011. Τ110
011101 characteristics pointed out by STREETS correspond rather with Streetsia
than with Xiphoceplzalus. From Doryceplzalus the genus may he distin-
guished by the inner ramus of the third pair of uropoda being free, not
0031080οἀ with the peduncle, and by the second pair of peraeopoda being
