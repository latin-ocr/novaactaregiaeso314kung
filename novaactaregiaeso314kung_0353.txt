DORYCEPHALUS. 75

Gen. 5. Doryeephalus‚ n. g.

Derivatioz δόρυ = a spear, and κέφαλος z a large-headed fisb, see ARISTOTELES.

Diayn. The head is long and narr0W‚ produced into a comparatively
short, narrOW‚ sharp-pointed rostrum, which is closed on the
under side. The hind part of the head is constricted, forming
a short, cylindrical neck.

The second pair of antennae are hidden under the head, when
folded.

The first two pairs of peraeopoda are subaheliform, or the
second are cheliform. The carpus and metacarpus of the
fifth pair are not dilated.

The last coalesced urat segxnent is a little more than twice
as long as the first, and somewhat more than three times
as long as broad.

The inner ramus of the third pair of uropoda is coalesced
With the corresponding peduncle.

The telson is narrowly triangular.

This new genus closely resembles Leptocotz's in general form of
body, but differs in the comparatively shorter and broader last ura]
segment and uropoda, and by the inner ramus of the last pair of uropoda
being coalesced with the peduncle. The type for the genus is Leptoeotis
Lindstroemi, briefly described by me in 1887 (35, p. 38). The new
species Leptocotis ambobus, proposed by STEBBING in 1888 (39, p. 1594)
certainly belongs to this genus, and at my first comparison of STEssmNG's
species with my own Ι supposed them to be identical‚ but after a close
re-examination of my specimens Ι must allow that there are some small
differences, which can scarcely be explained as individua] variations; but
on the other hand both are easily distinguished from Leptoeotis tenuirostris,
Omns, and L. spiniqem, Srnsnrs, by the form of the urus and its
appendages. Such being the case I record them here as two distinct
specles.

Α. The second pair of peraeopoda are subclieliform. The
femur of the seventh pair is half as long as that of
the sixth. 1. Ι). Lindstroemi.

Β. The second pair of peraeopoda are cheliform. The femur
of the seventh pair is not half as long as that of
the sixth. 2. Ι). ambobus.
