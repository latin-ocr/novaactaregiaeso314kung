is considerably shorter than the inner ramus, and a little shorter than the

outer3 the inuer ramus is lanceolate, sparingly serrated on both margins,

with spine-like teeth, and is more than three times as broad as the outer

rainus3 the outer ramus is almost styliform, and is two-thirds as long the

inner; it is smooth on the outer margin, and serrated on the inner.
The telson has the margins sinooth and tolerably convex.

COLOUR. Yellowish, with the eyes (lark brown.
LENGTH. 10 nnn.
ΗΑΒ. The tropical region of the Pacific, the Bay of Panama.

Pl. III, fig. 2—6; and 1). 25, fig. 205 p. 29, fig. 38; p. 32, fig. 52; p. 33, fig. 55.

Diayn. The head is a little longer than the whole peraeon, the rostrum is

scarcely more than a third part as long as the rest of the head.

The percron is dorsally rounded.

The under margin of the carpus of the first pair ofperceopoda

'is entirely sinooth, with the hind corner projecting into a
short, broadly triangular process3 the hind margin of the
inetacarpus is smooth, and is somewhat longer than the
under margin of the carpus3 the dactylus is scarcely a third
as long as the inetacarpus. The second pair are almost
ohelifor1n3 the sront margin of the carpal process is nearly
straight and entirely sniooth3 the hind margin of the meta-
carpus is smooth, and is a little longer than the front margin
of the cai-pal process; the dactylus is half as long as the
inetacarpus. The fourth pair are not longer than the third.
The lower hind corner of the femur of the sixth pair is pro-
duced downwards into a short, rounded process, which reaches
about to the apex of the genu. The femur of the seventh
pair is only a fourth part shorter than that of the sixth, and
is soinewhat longer than all the following joints together.

The pleon is not· carinated; the latera] parts of the segnients
are scarcely produced, but are angular behind.

The last coalesced zw‘al segment is about a third part longer
than broad, and is about as long as the telson.

The peduncle of the first pair of uropoda is longer than the last
coalesced ural segment, and much longer than the innerramus.
