of the animal, and that we thus may find them increasing or decreasing
in volume according to the stage of the development of the ovaria.

The other glands present within the joints of the legs have pro-
bably a different sunction, according to the place they occupy, aud so I
am inclined to think that the highly developed glands in the uropoda
and telson of Xiphocephalus are poison-glands.

73. The young.

The egge are in the family Oxycephalidae packed in, aud pro-
tected by a pouch formed of five pairs of ovitectrices‚ attached to the
second and four following pairs of peraeopoda. There the eggs rest until
the time of hatohing, when the young have a form very similar to that
Of a true Hyperia.

In the Xiphocephalidae also fl
the young remind one of the form ἡ Ὗ

the young are ready to be hatched we find that each egg is cernented
to the under sui-face of the peraeon with the head-end, and that the
young hang tail downwards (fig. 48 and 49).

The first pair of antennae in the just hatched young one of Xi-
phocephalus cousist of two small tubercles fixed at the anterior side
of the head, and no trace of a rostrum is to be seen. The first and
five following pairs of peraeopoda are developed, all simple and sub-
similar in form, and armed with strong claws‚ the first ancl second pairs
subequal in length, and more than half as long as the following pairs.
No trace of the seventh pair is to seen. The pleon and urus are com-
paratively short, much shorter together than the peraeon. The pleopoda
are represented by egg-shaped vesicles. The second and third ural seg-
ments are free, not coalesced, each carrying a pair of small vesicles‚ the
uropods (fig. 86).
