Xiphocephalus brevioaudatus comes near to X. armatus in
the form of the first and seventh peraeonal segments, in the somewhat
dilated femora of the fifth and sixth pairs, in the short first ura] seg-
ment, and in the very short outer rami of the uropoda; to X. Lillje—
bor-qi it shows relationship in the form of the first pair of peraeopoda‚
and in the length of the peduncle of the first two pairs of uropoda.
From all the other speeies it is easily distinguished by the serratiou of
the hind margin of the carpal process in the first pair of peraeopoda.

For further details I refer the reader to STEBBING'S work.
