CRANOCEPHALUS Gom. 97

serrated余 it is inore than twice as long as the inner ramus, which is a
little longer than the outer余 both rami are elongate-lanceolam, and are
serrated on both margins. The second pair reach fully to the apex
of the peduncle of the last pail-3 the peduncle is linear, more than four
times as long as broad, and quite twice as long as the inner ramus,
which is considerably longer than the outer and is serrated on both mar-
gins余 the outer ramus is smooth on the outer margin and serrated on
the inner. The third pair reach as far as four-fifths of the length of
the telson余 the peduncle is linea-r, more than twice as long as broad,
and considerably longer than the inner ramus, which is as long as the
outer and is serrated on both margins3 the outer ramus is serrated as
in the preceding pair.
The telson has the margins smooth and straight.

COLOUR. White as ivory, with red spots on the lower parts of the body, the
eyes are dark red.

LENGTH. S mm.

HAB. The tropical region of the Atlantia.

Gen. 8. Stebbing'ella, n. g.

The name is given in honour of the Rev. Tu. R. R. STEBBING.

Diayn. The head is nioderately long and broad, and is produced into
a tolerably long and sharp-pointed rostrum, which is closed
on the under side. The hind part of the head is constricted.

The second pair of antennae are hidden under the head, when
folded.

The first two pairs ofperaeopocla are subcheliform. The carpus
and metacarpus of the fifth pair are not dilated.

The last coalesced 'zm-al segment 15 longer than, but not twice
as long as, the first, and is only a little longer than broad.

The inner rami of all the three pairs of uropoda are free.
not coalesced with the corresponding peduncles.

The lelson is triangular, and sharp-pointed.

This genus has been established for the reception of those Oxy<
cephalids, which, according to my views as to the generic characteristics
shown in the family Oxycephalidae (see above p. 16) are intermediate
between the genera Ooeyceplzalus, Streetsz'a, and Leptocotz'S.
