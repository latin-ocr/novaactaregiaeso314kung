12 CARL BOVALLIUS, Tm: OXYCEPHALIDs.

II. THE SYSTEMATIOAL POSITION OF THE OXOYOEPHALIDS.

H. MILNE EDWARDs was the first who arranged the Hyperi-
idean genera, into subdivisions‚ establishing in 1840 the following three

mribus».

1. »Hype'rines qamo‘naro'idem), 2. »Hype'rines ordinaires» and 3. »Hy-
pe'rz'nes anormales». The characteristics used by him for distinguishing
these subdivisions were: —

l. The size of the head, »Tete petite» and »Tete tres grosse».

2. The width of the body, »Corps comprime» and »Corps renfle».

3. Maxillipeds with palps, — or wanting a palp.

4. The second pair of antennae straight, or zigzag-folded,-->)Antennes
de la seconde paire styliformes», and »Antennes de la seconde
pair se reployant sur elles memes, etc.»

Of these characteristies the tlzz'rd one, depending on a wrong observa-
tion, may be dropped without further discussi0n3 the second characteristic
varies, according to our present knowledge of the Hyperiidean species,
so very much, not only among closely allied genera and species, but also
in the case of the sexes of the same species, that it has no value what-
ever. The first characteristic varies in the case of two so nearlyrela-
ted families as Vibiliclae and Cyllopodidoe and may thus be assigned the
value of a family-characteristic, but not that of a subtribal one. The
fourth may be considered as a good characteristic; with regard to the
first subtribe‚ it may be observed however that the form of the second
pair of antennae of the first five falnilies in the following synoptical dia-
gram show some tendency to the »folding type», so strongly developed
in the Oceyceplzalidoe and their allies.

J. D. DANA, the next systematizer of the group, placed the Hyperide “
in three families, 1. Hisperz'dce, 2. Pltrom'znz'dse, and 3. Dyphidae. The
principa] characteristics were: —

1. The second pair of antennae extant, —— or able to be hidden

under the head or the body.
2. The hind part of the body able to be infiected or doubled up
under the body, — or not possessing this faculty.

3. The fifth and sixth pairs of legs mediocre, simple,-—0r thick,
elongated, osten prehensile.
