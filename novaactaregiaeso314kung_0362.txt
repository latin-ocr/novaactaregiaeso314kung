84 CARL BOVALLms, THE OXYCEPHALIDS.

(l. c. p. 1589, pl. 204 A> is not identioal with the present species, though
it seems to belong to the genus Streetsia. In the form of the urus and
of the first two pairs of peraeopoda it comes near to S‘treetsz'a carinam.

The short original description, of the species, given by CLAUs in
1879, and repeated in 1887, runs:

»Korper ziemlich gedrungen, mit glatiem, starkem Integument,
circa 8 mm. lang. Sohnabel massig lang, und shnauzenformig. Beine
minder gestreckt7 mit langen Krallen bewaffnet. Die Greifhande der
beiden vorderen Paare kurz und gedrungen. Letztes Beinpaar mit sehr
schmachtiger Platte, diinn und gestreckt. Die vorderen stark gezackt‚
die hinteren feingezahnelt. Abdomen sehr krztftig, glattrandig. Das
Caudaldoppelsegment kurz, merklich kiirzer als die Schwanzplatte.»

STEBfflNG gives in his Report of the »Challengern Amphiopoda an
exhaustive description and good drawings of Oxyoephalus porcellus,
Specimen A, which most probably is identical With CLAUS' O. porcellus.

Diayn. The head is as long as the peraeon and half the first pleonal
segment3 the rostrum is fully as long as the rest of the head.

The perman is dorsally rounded.

The under margin of the carpus of the first pair ofperoeopocla
is straight, with the hind corner obtusely rounded, not projec-
ting, and is serrated‚ with short, broad teeth3 the hind margin
of the metacarpus is feebly serrated‚ and is fully as long
as the under margin of the carpus; the dactylus is about a
fifth part as long as the metaoarpus. The under margin of
the carpus of the second pair is provided With a few short,
broad teeth, and has the hind corner very little produced,
and sharp-pointed3 the hind margin of the metacarpus is
armed with a few short, spine-like teeth along its lower
half, and is somewhat longer than the under margin of the
