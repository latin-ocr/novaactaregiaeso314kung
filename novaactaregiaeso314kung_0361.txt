Βὶαρη. The head is about as long as the whole perae0n3 the rostrum
is considerably more than half as long as the rest of the head.

The percum] is dorsally rounded.

The under margin of the carpus of the first pair of peroeopoda is
munded, without projecting corner, strongly denticulated, with
comparatively few, but very long and sharp, spine-like teeth3
the hind margin of the metacarpus is sparingly serrated;
the dactylus is longer than two-thirds of the metacarpus.
The under margin of the carpus of the second pair is finely
serrated, with the hind corner a little produced and sharp-
pointed; the hind margin of the metacarpus is serrated, and
considerably shorter than the under margin of the carpus3
the dactylus is longer than two-thirds of the metacarpus.
The fourth pair are not longer than the third. The lower
hind corner of the femur of the sixth pair is produced down-
wards into a short rounded process. The femur of the
seventh pair is about half as long as that of the sixth (P),
and somewhat longer than all the following joints together.

The pleon is not carinated; the lateral parts of all the segments
are somewhat produced behind, and sharp-pointed.

The last coalesced ural segment is about as long as broad,
and somewhat more than a fourth part shorter than the telson.

The peduncle of the first pair of uropoda is longer than the
last coalesced ural segment, and longer than the inner ramus.

The telson is not twice as long as broad.

Streetsi a porcellus differs from all its congeners in the broad urus
and in the form of the second pair of peraeopoda‚ and especially in the fine
serration on the under margin of the carpus of that pair. Iam pretty sure
