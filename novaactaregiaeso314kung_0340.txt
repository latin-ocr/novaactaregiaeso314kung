part of each segment is convex in front of the projecting tooth, and
concave behind it, the hind corner is produced, and sharp-pointed.

The last coalesced aral segment is about a fourth part longer
than broad.

The first pair of uropoda (Pl. ΙΙ, fig. 1) reach fully to the apex
of the last pair, but not to the apex of the telson3 the peduncle is ser-
rated on both margins, and is a little longer than the inner ramus, which
is somewhat longer than the outer, both being serrated. The second pair
reach to the middle of the inner ramus of the first pair, and to the apex
of the peduncle of the last pair3 the peduncle is quite as long as the
inner ramus, which is about a third part longer than, and more than
twice as broad as, the outer. The third pair are very broad, and
shorter than the telson; the peduncle is shorter than the inner ramus,
which is twice as broad ae, and a little longer than, the outer.

The telson is more than a third part longer than broad, triangular,
and is serrated along the margins.

COLOUR Light browuish to yellowish green.

Diayn. The body is compressed, the segments of the peraeon are
tuberculate.
The head is shorter than the peraeon, and has along rostrum.
The hind part of the head is shorter than the rostrum.
The front margin of the carpal process of the first two pairs
of per‘oeopoda is nearly as long as the hind margin of the
metacarpus, which is smooth‚ and provided with a few
bristles3 the lower front corner of the carpus protrudes,
forming a heel in front of the metacarpus. The fifth pair
are about as long as the sixth. The femur of the sixth
pair is broadly ovate, a little broader than that of the fifth
pair, and more than twice as long as that of the seventh,
which itself is more than twice as long as all the follow-

ing joints together.
