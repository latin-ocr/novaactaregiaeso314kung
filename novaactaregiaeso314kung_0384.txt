Diayn. The head in the male is as long as the first four peraeonal
segmeuts together, in the female as long as the first three;
the rostrum is about half as long as the rest of the head.

The metacarpus of the first pair of perceopoda has the hind
margin entirely smooth, and the lower front corner only
feebly produced. The third pair are considerably longer
than the fourth and a little longer than the fifth. The carpus
of the fifth pair is more than twice as long as the tibia. The
sixth pair are shorter than the fifth. The seventh pair do not
reach fully to the apex of the tibia of the sixth pair.

The lateral parts of the pleonal segments are rounded behind.

The first and second pairs of w‘opocla reach about to the
apex of the last pair.

The integument of the body is smooth, without tubercles or ex-
cavations, hard and bright as if polished.

The ros—trum is very broad at the apex, in the male half as broad
as the ocular region, in the female a little narrower.

The first pair of antennae in the male are less curved than usual-
ly in this family, and have the front corner of the first flagellarjoint not
at all projectiug3 the first fiagellar joint is not twice as long as broad3 the
second joint is longer than the third, and as long as the fourth; these last
three joints together are nearly twice as long as the under margin of
the first joint. The first pair in the female are robust, with the first
flagellar joint thick and tumid‚ and nearly as long as the two following
joints together. The second pair in the male are six-jointed3 the first
joint is somewhat curved, and considerably shorter than the second, which
is shorter than the third; the fourth joint is a little shorter than the
second, the fifth and sixt-h are short, equal in length, and together about
an eighth part of the length of the fourth joint.

The first two segments of the perceon are short and together scarcely
as long as the third, the first three segments together are somewhat
