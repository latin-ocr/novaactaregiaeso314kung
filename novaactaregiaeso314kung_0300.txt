22 CARL BovALLIUS, THE OXYCEPHALms.

3. The head.

The shape of the head of the Oxycephalids shows forms gradually
developing almost from the normal type in Lyccoez'dffl to the strange-look-
ing, extremely elongated form in Xiphocephalidae. The genus Glosso-
cephalus has a distinct, but thick ¹<ind obtuse, tongue-shaped rostrum
(fig. 6 and 6 a), Oxycephalus (fig. 7 and 8), Stebbingella (fig. 3), and
Streetsia (fiig. 9) offer different steps of development of a more and
more elongated and sharp rostrum, open at the under-side; in Dory-
cephalus and Leptocotis (fig. 10) it has reached the formos a needle,
Which form is so enormously developed in Xiphocephalus, that. it may
be properly called filiform (fig. 2).

An aberrant development of the rostral or anterior part of the
head occurs in Galam orhynchus where the dilation of the basal portion
of the rostrum, which is indicated already in Tullbergella (fig. 12), is
exaggerated into the large wing-like projections shown in fig. 11.

But also the hind part of the head shows a gradual development
from being in Streetsia not constricted‚ in Oxycephalus, Grano-
cephahoe, Tnllbmgella, and Stebbingella‚ feebly constricted and
scarcely forming a distinct neck, to Dorycephalus, Leptocotis and Cala-
morhynchus, where the hind part of the head is strongly constricted‚
forming a distinct, but short neck, and lastly to Xiphocephalus‚ which
has a long and narrow neck, longer than the centra} part of the head (fig. 2),
