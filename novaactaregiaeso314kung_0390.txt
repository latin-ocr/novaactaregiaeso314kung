112 CARL BOVALmus, THE OxrcEPHAmns.

The dactylus of the first two pairs of perceopocla is half as
long as the metacarpus. The whole seventh pair are not
half as long as the femur of the sixth.

The latei-al parts of the first two pleonal segments are square
behind⁷ not produced3 that of the third segmentis produced
behind into a long, spineus process.

From the first description of the species published in 18771 give
the following passages:

»Head long, with the rostrum longer than the thorax3 Vertical
diameter of the head greater posteriorly than ante1·iorly; the superior
surface on a higher level than the dorsum of the thorax3 abruptly con-
stricted behind the eyes and in front of the first thoracic segment3 the
inferior berder slightly convex; the under surface hollowed out on each
side anteriorly in the form of fossae for the reception of the superior
antennae3 supra-fossal margin arched and slightly elevated3 rostrum long,
acute, slightly arched. — — —. Thorax seven-jointed3 segments increa-
sing in length posteriorly; epimerals long, broadly ovate⁷ transversely
rugose. Gnathopoda short chelate3 the second pair longer than the first3
carpus of first pair scarcely produced anteriorly, and inferiorly serrated3
propcdos broad, serrated on inferior margin3 dactylus half the length of

the propodos, arched, with a minute spine about the middle of the in· ⁴

ferior sursace, antagonizing with the extremity of the carpus. Second
pair having the carpus more produced anterior-ly than the first. extending
to, or slightly beyond, the apex of the propodos, and terminating in a
long fine point; propodos and dactylus similar to the first pair. — —- ——
Fifth pair rudimentary, coxa dilated, small, with the 1·emainingjoints not
half as long as the coxa of the preceding pair.———— Caudal
appendages long, cylindffical, serrated along their inner margins, bira-
mous3 outer pair longer than the two following; ultimate short, reaching
further than the inner. Telson long, cylindrical, extending beyond the
extremities of the lamellae».

From his later description in 1878 the following may be added:
»Head long, excluding the rostrum, as long as the thorax3 -- - —
rostrum slightly more than one-third the length of the head (including
its own length) slender, acute, sligthtly arched. — —— —- The second
