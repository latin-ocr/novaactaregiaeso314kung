32 CARL BOVALmth, THE OxroEPHALms.

This is the. same form of prehensile organ
which exists in the third and fourth and also in
the fifth pair of peraeopoda in Eutlzem.ist0 and Para-
themisto. Moreover the folding hand is common
in the Amphipoda Gamnaridea, in the first three
pairs of peraeopoda in some families of Isopoda, and
is probably most strongly developed in the first pair
of Squilla and other Stomatopods.

The next step in the development of these
organs is represented in many genera⁷ as for in-
stance in the second pair in Simo rhyn elnotus, the
first pair in Streetsia (fig. 52), the first pair in
Doryoephalus, the first and second pairs in Tullbergella (fig. 51),
and in others, that is to say:

The next form, the most developed prehensile orgen, is best re-
presented in the second pair of peraeopoda in the genus Oxyoephalus
(fig. 54), but is also met with in the first pair in the same genus, in the
second pair in Streetsia (fig. 55), and in others3 that is to say:
