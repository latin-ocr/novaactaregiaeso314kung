OXYCEPHALUS LATIROSTRIS. 67

The lateral parts of the pleonal segments are feebly rounded in
front, and almost straight beloW‚ the under margins being with-
out tooth-like p1·ojections; the hind corner of each is angular.

The last coalesced ¹umal segment is about twice as long as
the telson.

The telson is much shorter than the last pair of uropoda.

Oxycephalus latirostris agrees in some characteristics with
O. piscator, as for instance in the length and general form of the cheli-
form hand in the second pair of peraeopoda⁷ and in the form of the
urus and its appendages‚ but the distinguishing characteristics are many.
From Ο. pectinata-s it is, as I have already said (p. 62), easily distinguished.

The ἤρας] is a little longer than the first six peraeonal segments
together. The rostrum is less than a third part of the length of the
rest of tho head.

The perceon shows a slight transversal depression on the dorsal
side of each segment.

The first pair of peroeopocla (Pl. H, fig. 9> are shorter than the
second; the lower front corner protrudes a little in front of the base
of the metacarpus3 the carpal process is much shorter than thc stem of
the joint, but longer than the hind margin of the metacarpus, and is
serrated along the front margin. with strong, equal, rounded teeth; it is
also serrated along the hind margin. The metacarpus is considerably
shorter than the stein of the carPuS, and serrated like the carpal process.
The dactylus is shorter than a fourth part of the metacarpus, and has a
blunt tooth at the hind margin. The second pair (Pl. H, fig. 10) have
the cheliform hand much longer than the first, the carpus, without the
process, being half as long again as the inetacarpus; the hincl margin of
the carpus and of the process is set with short slender bristles3 the carpal
process is serrated along the front margin as in the first pair, and
reaches almost to the apex of the dactylus. The metacarpus and dacty-
lus are like those in the first pair. The fifth pair are the longest;
the femur is elongate-ovate, more than twice as long as broad, and shorter
than the three following joints together. The femur of the sixth pair
(Pl. ll, fig. ΙΙ) is narrowly pear-shaped‚ with the margins smooth, twice
