XIPHocsPHALus izssssvicAqu'rus. 133

The uras is scarcely longer thau the last two pleon-‘il segments
together, and is thicker‚ and more robust, than in the two preceding
species. The first segment is quite as long as the last coalesced
segment.

The first pair of uropoda are about a fifth part longer than the
last pair, aud reach far beyond the middle of that pair; the first pair
are more than. a third part longer than the second⁷ and have the outer
ramus about as long as the iuner. The second pair reach far beyond
the apex of the last coalesced ural segment‚ and have the outer ramus
only a little shorter than the inner. The third pair reach almost to
the apex of the telson, and have the outer ramus not half as long as
the inner.

The telson is comparatively thick, is straight and sharp-pointed,
and is quite as long as the urus.

Diayn. The head, without the rostrum, is longer than the whole peraeon.
The neck is a third part longer than the ocular region.

The seventh per-ceonal segment is only a little shorter than
the sixth3 the hind part of the epimeral is somewhat deeper
than the front part, and is broadly rounded.

The epimeral of the first pair of peroeopoda is as deep as
long (?), wit-h rounded corners. The carpal process of the
first pair is finely denticulated on the hind margin3 the lower
hind corner of the metacarpus is squared. The femur of
the fifth and sixth pairs is moderately dilated.

The pleon is dorsally smooth, not carinated (?).

The first aral segment is half as long as the last coalesced
segment.

The first pair of uropoda are much longer than the third;
the second pair are much longer than the last coalesced
ural segment, and are quite as long as the third pair. The
outer ramus of the first pair is about half as long as the
inner; that of the second pair is not a sixth part as long

as the inner3 that of the third pair is minute, not a tenth
part as long as the inner.
