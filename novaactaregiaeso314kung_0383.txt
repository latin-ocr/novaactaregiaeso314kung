Diayn. The head is oomparatively short and broad, and produced
into a broad rostrum, which is rounded in front. The under
side of the rostrum is open. The hind part of the head
is constricted.

The second pair of antemzce are hidden under the head. when
folded‚ and, to a small extent, under the peraeon.

The first two pairs of pet'oeopocla are cheliform. The carpus
and metaearpus of the fifth pair are much dilated.

The last coalesced ura! segment is longer than, but not twice
as long as, the first, and is only a little longer than broad.

The inner rami of all the three pairs of uropoda are free,
not coalesoed with 1116 corresponding pedunoles.

The telson is short, and tongue-shaped.

This genus is most easily distinguished from all the other genera
of the family by the much dilated tibia, carpus, and metacarpus of the
fifth pair of peraeopoda, and also by the wide, almost cup-shaped carpus
of the first two pairs. The dilated form of the joints of the fifth pair
strikingly recall that feature in 1116 sixth pair οϊΡΙιοι-εονῐια111113,8111331116.

and LyeoeoZJSiS, CLAUS.

The genus contains hitherto two species:

Α. Τ116 hind margin of the nietaearpus of the first pair
of peraeopoda is smooth. The seventh pair are
longer than the femur of the sixth. 1. G. Milue-Edwardsi.

Β. The hind margin of the metaoarpus of the first pair

of peraeopoda 15 arnied with a strong tooth. The
seventh pair are shorter than the femur ofthe sixth. 2. G. spiniger.
