CRANOCEPHALUS Gonsl. 95

The genus Oranocephalus is well defined from all the other
genera of the family. In the short head and in the second pair of antennae
being concealed under the head aml tlte perceon it resembles δίιηονΙιψισΙιοιαε
and Tullberyella; in the form of the peraeopoda it comes tolerably near
to Stebbz'nyella, which also has broadly expanded femora in the last three
pairs. Only one species is hitherto known.

1. Cranoceplialus Goesi, n. sp.
The name is given in honour of D:r AXEL Goiis of Kisa, Sweden.

Diayn. The body is smooth and even, with a thin but hard integument.
The head is nearly as long as the first six peraeona] segments
together3 the hind part is a little constricted3 the broadly
triangular rostrum is scarcely half as long as the rest of

the head.

The under margin of the carpus of the first pair ofperceopocla
is entirely smooth, with the hind corner projecting into a short
sharp tooth3 the hind margin is strongly serrated, without
spines or bristles, the hind margin of the metacarpus is as
long as the free under margin of the carpus, and forms an
edge which is smooth on the hind margin but armed with
a few sharp teeth on the under margin. The under margin
of the carpus of the second pair 18 smooth, with the apical
tooth somewhat longer than in the first pair; the hind
margin is feebly serrated, and providod with some very
short bristles; the hind margin of the metacarpus is about
as long as the free under margin of the caerS, the upper
part is smooth3 the lower obliquely truncated end 18 provid-
ded with a few strong teeth. The femur of the sixth pair
18 a fifth part longer than broad, with the lower hind corner
produced downwards into a broadly rounded process⁷ which
reaches to the apex of the genu. The seventh pair reach
to the apex of the carpus of the sixth pair.

The lateral parts of the pleonal segments are a little produced
behind, and sharp-pointed.

The peduncle of the first and second pairs of uropocla 18
fully twice as long as the inner ramus.
