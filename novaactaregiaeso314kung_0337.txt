joints together. The femur of the sixth pair is irregularly pear—shaped‚
a fifth part longer than broad, only a little broader than the femur of
the fifth pair, and shorter than the four following joints together; the
front margin of the tibia is fringed with a row of spines, one longer one
and one very short one alternating; the front margin of the carpus has
a similar row of spines, one longer one and two very short ones alter-
nating3 the front margin of the dactylus is sparingly serrated. The se-
venth pair (Pl, I⁷ fig. 14), reach to the middle of the carpus of the
sixth; the femur is pear-shaped, and somewhat shorter than all the follow—
ing joints together3 the metacarpus is a little longer than the carpus,
but shorter than the tibia.

The under margins of the pleonal segments are more or less
rounded, sometimes une-ven, but not produced into tooth-like projec-
tions as in Ooeyceplzalzcs Clausi.

The last coalesced ural segment is a little more than a third part
longer than broad.

The first pair of molioda (p. 39, fig. 75) reach to the apex of the
last, and to the apex of the telson; the peduncle is a little longer than
the inner ramus, which is a little longer than the outer; both rami are
strongly· serrated. The secon d pair reach a little beyond the apex of the
peduncle of the first pair⁷ and very little beyond the base of the last pair3
the peduncle is somewhat longer than the inner ramus, and twice as long
as the outer. The third pair reach scarcely beyond the apex of the
telson; the peduncle is as long as the inner ramus, which is a trifle
longer than the outer.

The telson is only about a sixth part longer than broad, and
triangular, the margins being very convex, and serrated.
