Rhabsosoma leitez', SPENCE, BATE, is not a species by itselfbut only the
male form of th. armatum, H. Mxmffi EDWARDs, a mistake, which will be
duly cleared up under ))Xiphocephalus» below. He established also the
new genus Simorhynclzu.s·, with the new species S. antennarius, and a new
species of Ooeyceplzabzffi, 0. ϊεηιιὶνοείνὶε, mentioned below as Leptocotis
tenuirostris. In the same paper he said, »Die Gattung Synopz'a, DANA,
die DANA and SPENCE BA'FE irrthiimlich mit den Oxycephaliden vereinigt
haben, gehort zu den Gammariden». Among the Oxycephalidae he
mentioned then Snelzagyevzz'a, n. g. later transferred to the Lycaeids.

In 1877 THOMAS H. STREETs, ⁶24, described under the name Oxy-
ceph ¹alus tuberculatiis, SPENCE ΒΑΤΕ an animal which Ι really think may
prove to be identical with SPENCE BATE's species; he further instituted
the new genus Leptocotis with the new species L. spinifera.

In 1878 CLAUs, 25, gave some interesting notices about the beart
and vessels of Oxycephalidae and other Hyperids.

In the same year THOMAs H. STREE'rs, 26, described fron] the Pa-
cific the following Oxycephalids viz; Ooeyceplzalus tuberculatus, SPENCE BATE,
which, however, is not identical with SPENCE BATE's species but with O.
Clausi, C. BOVALLms3 O. bulbosiffi, n. sp„ O. sclerofficus, n. sp. Lepto-
cotis spinifera, STREETs, Calamorhynchus, n. g. with G. pellucidus‚
n. sp., Rhabdosoma leitei, SPENCE ΒΑΤΕ, Rh. armatum, H. MILNE EDWARDS,
and Rlz. lonqirostris, SPENCE BATE, the latter synonymous with Xipho-
cephalus armatus, H. Mam: EDWARDs. It is noticeable that he did
not himself find the specific difference between the Oxycephalus tuber-
culatus, described by him in 1877 and the O.tuberezclatus, mentioned in
this his latter paper. The descriptions are accompanied with drawings
which are not very good, being executed in a small scale.
