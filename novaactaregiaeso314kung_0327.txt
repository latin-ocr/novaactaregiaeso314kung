SIMORHYNCHO'PUS ANTENNARlUs. 49

1. Simorhynehotus antennam-ius, C. Chaos, 1861.

Diaflvz. The head, with 1110 10511111 prolongation, 15 about 35 long 35
1110 five first peraeonal segments together. The rostral part
is very broad, thick, and obtuse 111 1110 apex.

The lower anterior corner of the first flagellar joint of the
first pair of amenum in the male is produced into a process,
which is 111010 than half as long 115 1110 breadth of the joint.

The 10111111· of the first and second pairs ofpercoeopoda is much
longer 1111111 all 1110 following joints together. The femur of
the seventh pair is scarcely more than half as long as that of
the sixth, and much narrower than the femur of the fifth pair.

The pedunole 01 1110 first pair of cm‘opocla 15 35 long as the
inner ramus, and longer 1111111 1110 011101.

The tels-on 15 as long as broad, with the apex sharp-pointed.

All these three descriptions, just cited, are ineomplete, and there-
fore the drawing given by CLAUs in 1887 was of much value for the
identification of the species, In addition to the 0113130101151105 given in
the diagnosis above the following may 3150 be mentioned.

The head rises 11 little above the peraeon, but does not form a
distinet neok behind. Seen from below the under side of the rostral¹>
portion is flat, and broader than a third part of the head.

The lower hind corner of the first flagellar joint of the first pair
of antenna? is produced downwards to the middle of the third joint. The
second, third, and fourth flagellar joints are about equal in length.

The sixth perceonal seg-ment is longer than the fifth, the seventh
is more than half as long as the sixth.

The metaearpus of the first pair of perceopoda is shorter than
the earpus; the dactylus is about half as long 35 1110 metaearpus. The

1) By the rostrum 01· the rostral portion of 1110 head is here always meant
the part situated between the point of fixation of the first pair of antennae and the
apex of the head.
