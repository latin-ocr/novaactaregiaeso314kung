XlrnoCEPnALUs ARMATUS. 121

1131310110» 111 Paris were all Xiphocephalus armatus, after my
diagnosis3 one of these 8110011110118, 11131 marked «Ozzyceplialfus armatum,
MihNE Enwmzns, (3210ss et Gaz'nzaJdJ), and therefore most likely his ori-
ginal specimen, 1138 been the type for the diagnosis and description
Ι have given here, and froin it the drawing 1138 also been made

(Pl. vi, fig. 1).

Annis and Wni'rm gave no specific description⁷ but 3 good draw-

ing, the first published of this species, A copy of it on 3 reduced scale
is given below (Pl. VI, fig. 14).

SPENCE BATE in 1858 proposed the new genericand specific name
Macrocephalus Ionyirostrz‘S, taking for his type the very specimen that
was the original of the drawing given in 1848 by ADAMS and WfflTE.
This being the case there is not the slightest doubt 38 10 1110 identity
of Xiphocephalus 3111131118 with Macrocephali& lonyirostris.

The description given by SPENCE Birra in 1862 18 very good‚and
points out some valuable 0113130101181108, 38 for instance the 0311131 1110-
0088 of 1110 first 11311 peraeopoda having 3 secondary 100111 011 1110 hind
margin, the sixth pair being shorter 111311 1110 fifth, and the second pair
of nropoda not being longer 111311 1110 1381 11131 segment. But with 10811001
10 the first pair of uropoda he 18 111 01101, 38 1110 original drawing of the
311111131, which was made 31 the capture, clearly shows (Pl. VI, fig. 14);
and 38 ADAMs and Wfflm 38 early 38 111 1848 stated that the specimen
then was in bad order there is no wonder 11131- the later drawing and
description are soinewhat incorr-eet.

ΤΗ. STREET'S description of the specics, published in 1878,18
valuable, 38 it. records two good specific 0113130101181108, 1101 31111100131οἀ
before, namely the form of the under part of the seventh peraeonal seg-

peraeopoda3 the accompanying drawing 18 1101 good. His contention
for maintaining 3 Rlzabdosoma lonqirostre, which is based on the incorrect
figure in SPENOE BATE's catalogue, pl. 54, fig. 6, 1138 110 great weight‚
as Ι have said above. We must rely rather upon the original drawing
from the fresh specimen than upon the later figure made from the same
specimen in 3 bad state.

CLAus in 1871 (8, p. 155), 1879, and 1887 argued that Rhab-
dosoma Whitei was ‘the male form of Rlz. armatum, and thus his descrip-
