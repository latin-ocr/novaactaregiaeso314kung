latera] laminae are often tuberculated and serrated or sparingly set with
short bristles or fine hairs.

8. The peroeon ond its appendaqes.

According to ‘the varying forn] of body in the different genera
the peraeon is short and siout, as in Tullbergella (fig. 1), or long and
almost rod-like, as in Xiphocephalus (fig. 2), but it may be obser-
ved that in the enormous elongation which occurs for instance in
Xiphocephalus, has the peraeon comparat-ively less share than ‘she
head, the urus, and the pleon.

The epimerals are distinct in all the genera of the Oxycepha-
lidae (fig. 1, 3, 4, 5 and 271, but in the Xiphocephalidae only the
epimeral os the first pair of peraeopoda is distinct, the others being coa—
lesced with the corresponding segmenta (fig. 46 and 47).

The branchia! vesicle-s· are attached to the second and sour
following pairs of peraeopoda in all species of both. families. Those in
the Oxycephalidae are comparatively small, while those in the Xipho-
cephalidae are very large (fig. 46 and 47).

in form, the lower end being produced into a sharp angle.
