leuooEPHALUs ARMATL's. 123

The perceon. The first segment is two—thirds as long as the sec-
ond3 the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth are equal in length3 the seventh
is only 3 little shorter than the sixth.

The epimeral of the first pair of peraeopoda (Pl. VI, fig. 6> is
free from, and articulating with, the first segment; it is deeper than long,
evenly rounded, almost tongue—shaped‚ and has the front margin serrated.
The epimerals of the following pairs arc coalesced with the correspond-
ing segments3 those of the second, third, fourth, and fifth pairs have the
under margin almost straight and sligthly serr-ated, and the corners ob-
tusely rounded; that of the sixth pair has the hind portion somewhat
deeper thau the front. part, and circularly rounded; the epimeral of tho
seventh pair (Pl. Vl, fig. 5) has the under margin dumbbell-shaped, as
STREETS justly remarks (26, p. 289), the hind portion being less deep
thau the front part, and circularly rounded.

The bran‹;el1ial vesicles are very large, tumid, elongate-eggshaped.
and attached to the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth pairs of peraeo-
poda in thc male, as well as in the felnale3 that of the second pair is
longer than the whole leg, those of the following pairs are a little shorter
than the correspouding femora3 those of the fifth aud sixth pairs are
thicker‚ and more tumid, than the preceding.

The perceopoda. The first pair (Pl. VI, fig. 7, and p. 34, fig.
57) are very short, and are, when folded up, almost concealed by
the large epimeral3 the carpus is very broad3 the carpal process is
triangular, much longer than the stem of the carpus, and has a large
sharp tooth at the middle of the hiud margin3 the front margin is ser-
rated, and is much longer than the hiud margin of the metacarpus,
reaching about to the apex of the dactylus; the hind portion of the
metacarpus forms a thiu sharp edge, and has the lower corner triangular-
ly produced and sharp-pointed3 the dactylus is stout, cur-ved, and about
three-fourths as long as the metacarpus. The second pair (Pl. Vl,
fig. 8) are a little longer than the first, and have the carpus com-
paratively less dilated3 the carpal process is somewhat curved, and
reaches sully to the apex of the dactylus. The third and fourth
pairs (Pl. VI, fig. 9) are similar in shape, but the fourth is somewhat
longer3 the femur is linear, about five times as long as broad3 the tibia
is longer than the femur, is linear in the male, and often also in the
female, being about five or six times as long as broad; but in the ovi-
gerous female the joint is inore or less inflated, containing highly de-
veloped glands. The femur of the fifth pair is a little dilated, being
