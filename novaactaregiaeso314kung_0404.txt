The original description of SPENCE BATE in 1862 was fully suf-
ficient for the identification of his species. I give here the 1110511111-
portant passages of it.

)›—— — Sixth seglnent of the pleon (z the last coalesced ural seg-
nient) not longer than the preceding. ——-— First pair of gnathopoda
having the coxa (Ξ the epimeral) anteriorly produced to an obtuse point;
carpus broadly infero-anteriorly produced as far as the inferior angle
of the propodos3 propodos short, stout, inferior angle anteriorly pro-
duced3 dactylos long, arcuate, capable of antagonizing at the apex With
the extremity of the carpus only. Second pair of gnathopoda much
longer than the first3 carpus infero-anteriorly produced beyond the ex-
tremity of the propodos7 the process being slender and curved, terminat-
ing in a fine point3 propodos increasing towards the distal extreniity‚
’ inferior angle slightly anteriorly produced3 dactylos arcuate, antagonizing
at the extremity with the apex of the carpus. Pei-eiopoda gradually in-
creasing in length posteriorly, the fourth pair being the longest; fifth
obsolete. Antepenultimate pair of pleopoda reaching to half the length
of the ultimate3 peduncle having the outer margin coarsely, the inner
finely serrated: penultiniate pair originating on the inner side of the
preceding, and longer than the sixth segment of the pleon (= the last
coalesced ural segnient); peduncle having the outer margin coai·se13³‚tlie
inner finely serrated3 ultimate pair nearly as long again as the sixth

1) SPENCE ΒΛΤΕ, 111 his publication of 1861 (19, p. 15, pl. 1, fig. 4) gave
a drawing of the animal, and mentioned the nanie lelnlosmna H'ln'tei„ bnt only in
the explanation of the platos, and without the slightest description.
