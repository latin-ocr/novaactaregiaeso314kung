GLOSSOCEPHALUS MlLNE-EDWARDSI. 107

shorter than the fifth, which is the longest of 311; 1116 sixth and seventh
segments are equal in length. The epimerals are long⁷ irregularly
rounded below, and fully 38 long as the under margins of the cor-
responding segments.

The first two pairs of Jn’rreopocla are very small in comparison
with the following pairS, and have the carpus shaped as 311 egg with the
« 1ορ obliquely cut off. The carpal process of the first pair is armed
on the outer margin with two spine-like 166111, 311(1 18 sharp-pointed at
the apex3 the metacarpus is longer than the stem of the carpus3 the
hind margin is straight, smooth, and sharp, and is longer than the front
side of the carp-al process3 the front margin is convex, with the apex
produced into a very short, and feebly curved tooth3 the dactylus is
smooth on the hind margin, and fully half as long 38 1116 11161363111118.
The second pair are closely similar to the first, but the outer margin
of the carpal process wants teeth3 the metacarpns is only a little longer
than the stem of the carpuS, and has the hind margin concave, smooth,
and a little longer than the front side of the carpal process; the dactylus
is not more than a third part as long as the metacarpus, and has the hind
margin smooth. The third pair are very slender and elongated‚ more
than nine times as long as the second pair7 the femur and tibia are much
elongated, being more than eight times as long as broad. The fourth
pair are like the third, but shorter. The fifth pair have the femur dilated,
and not fully three times as long as broad3 the front margin is serrated2
the tibia is dilated‚ not twice 38 long as broad3 the carpus is much di-
lated, about as broad as the femur, and a little more than twice as long
38 11 18 broad 31 1116 apex3 the metacarpus is dilated, 13110601316, with
both margins finely serrated, and is about as long as 1116 carpus; the
dactylus is very short. The sixth pair are about a fifth part shorter
than the fifth pair, and have the femur somewhat narrower3 the tibia and
carpus are dilated, but not as much 38 111 1116 preceding pair; the meta-
carpus is 38 long 38 1116 two preceding joints together, and is finely
serrated on both margins. The femur of the seventh pair is broadly
ovate, more than half as long as 11131 of the sixth pair⁷ and about a
fourth part longer 111311 all the following joints together.

The pleon is 3 little longer than the last three peraeonal segments
together, and is not carinated.

The last coalesced ural segment is quite as long 38 11 18 broad
at the base, and 1138 1116 margins convex; it is two and 3 half times 38
long 38 1116 1618011.
