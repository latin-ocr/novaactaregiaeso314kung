70 CARL Romanus, THE OXYCEPHALIDS.

The last coalesced aral segment is about as long as the telson.
The telson is rounded at the apex. and reaches quite to the
apex of the last pair of uropoda.

Syn. 1887. Tullbergella cuspidatim, C. BOVALLIUS. 35, p. 38.

Tullbergella cuspidata is probably the stoutest and most
robust of all the Oxycephalids. The integument of the body is thicker
and harder than in the other representatives of the family, Slebbz'nyella
The'elz' perhaps excepted. The form of the rostrum shows, as mentioned
above, some tendency towards the »wing-like projections» 60 enormously
developed in the genus Calamorliyncltus.

The head (p. 20, fig. 1 and p. ⁶23, fig. 12) 16 somewhat longer
than the first four peraeonal segments together, and is scarcely longer
in the male than in the female. The ocular region forms on each
side a large- hemispherical intuinescence, which stands out globularly
from the sui-face cf 1116 head. The hindest portion of the head
shows a feeble constriction, but does not form a neck. The rostrum
is very broad at the base, with almost parallel, and somewhat bulging
sides for about half its length3 the distal half of the rostrum is
triangular with the apex sharp—pointed. This shape of rostrum forms a
transition froin that in Oaryceplzal'zts to the extremely dilated rostral por-
tion of 1116 head in Calaneorliyflzclms.

The eyes· (p. 23, fig. 12) are separated from one another by a com-
parative-ly broad strip at the crown of the head.

The first pair of antemeoe in the male (p. 25, fig. 18) are very
thick and robust3 the first joint of the flagellum is scarcely more than
a third longer than it is broad at the base; the three following joints
together are much shorter than the breadth of the firstjoint3 the second
flagellar joint is much thicker than, and about twice as long as, the third;
the fourth is slender, and nearly as long as the second. In the female
the first pair (fig. 23) are inore curved than in the preceding genus3 the
flagellum consists of three joints3 the first is twice 66 broad at the base
as at the apeX, and a little shorter than the two followingjoints together.
The second pair in the male (p. 26, fig. 27) have the firstjoint shorter
than half the second, the third a trifle longer than the second, the fourth
considerably shorter thau the third, and the last or fifth joint very short,
scarcely equalling one-twentieth of the length of the fourth. All the
joints are closely fringed with short hairs along the under margins.
