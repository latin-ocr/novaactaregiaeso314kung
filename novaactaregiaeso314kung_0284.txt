6 ΟΑΒι BOVALLms, THE OXYCEPHALIDs.

In 1864 ACHILLE CosrA, 21, without referring to the genus Oxyce-
phalus or to the family Oxycephalidae, instituted a kind of subfamily,
Ornz'tlzoramplzz'ni‚ for 1116 reception of the genus Ornithoramplzu& NATALE,
and the two new genera Natalius and Carcinorm's. On the synonymy
of the first genus see above p. 3, the genus Natalius is probably syno-
nymous with OxycephaIUS, and the new species N. candidissimus, pos-
sibly is O. piscator, H. MILNE EDWARDs; the genus Carcinorm's is diffi-
cult to identify, it comes perhaps near to Stre etsia, Smnnma, or Lep-
tocotis, STREETs, because the form of the first two pairs ofperaeopoda
alluded to in the diagnosis is most similar 101116 form of those pairs in the
two mentioned genera3 of this latter genus Cam-immas he established two
new species C. aeutirostrz's, and C. infiaticeps; the suggestion of STEBBmG
1. c. p. 347 that the latter may prove to be synonymous 10 Ooeyceplzalus
typltoides, Cmus, is, according to my opinion, not supported by the few
characteristics given by OOSTA3 see below under »Stre etsia».

In 1867 cosm, 22, mentioned Ornithoramplms Commi, NATALE, among
a collection of Mediterranean crustaceans sent to the exhibition in
Paris that year.

In 1871 C. CLAUS, 23, gave some short notices 0111116 anatomy of
the Oxycephalids, mentioning a vesicular organ in the hind part of the
head3 this vesicle he regarded as an auditory organ3 he described further
the structure of the eyes, the nervous system, and the organs of circula-
tion. At the same time he gave a new diagnosis of the genus 06966-
phalica, and described as Ο. piscator, H. Mam: EDWARDS, the animal which
here below is named O. Clausi, he argued further that O. oceanicus,
Gummi, is synonymous with O. piscator, H. MILNE EDWARDs, a fact
which Gutum-Mammam already in 1841, himself had proved, 8, and that
