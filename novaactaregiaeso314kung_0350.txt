length, and serrated3 the inner ramus is bro-ader than the outer. The
third pair reach fully to the apex of the telson; the peduncle is half
as long as the inner ramus, which is more than twice as broad as, and
a little longer than, the enter. Ἰ

The seleon is triangular, with cnrved margins, and is a little
longer than it is broad at the base.

COLOUR. Brownish, wit-h dark red spots,
LENGTH. 9—13 mm.

Gen, 4. Calamorhynohus, TH. STREETS, 1878.

Diagyn. The head is long and broad, produced into a long⁷ broadly
dilated and sharp-pointed rostrum, Which is open on the under
side. The hind part cf the head is ccustricted, forming a
short neck.

The second pair of amenum are hidden under the head, when
folded (ΣΡ).

The first two pairs of perceopoda are subchelisorm. The carpus
and metacarpus of the fifth pair are not dilated.

The last coalesced mal segment is nearly three times as long
as the first, and nearly four times as long as it is broad.
The inner ramus of the third pair of uropocla is coalesced

with the corresponding peduncle.
The telson is elongated‚ and narrowly triangular.

This genus is at the first view easily distinguished from all the
other genera by the peculiar forn] of the head, with its wing-like
expausions of the rostrum; in this characteristic Tullberyella comes
nearest to it, but is very different from it in almost all other
points.

Beside the typical species, Calamorhynchus pellucidus, de-
scribed in 1878 by Srnsms, another, O. rigidus, is given by STEBBING
