When CLAUs in 1861 instituted the genus Simorlzgmclzus he placed
it in the family Oxycephalidae3 in 1879 he removed it from this fa-
mily and put it among the Lycoeicloe. In my opinion however it must
be regarded as an Oxycephalid‚ so Ι have placed it here as the first
genus of the family Oxycephalidae, chiefly for the reason that the
mouth-organs agree with those in the Oxycephalidae in the form of
the mandibles and maxiffipeds, and in the rudimentary state of the
maxillae. Also in the form of the last five pairs of peraeopoda there is
a great resemblance between this genus and the genus Ooeycephalua It
is however a link between the Oxycephalidae and the Lyaeidoe, con-
necting these two families for Which it is so hard to find good distin-
guishing characteristics, since the princip-al characteristic used by CLAUS,
namely the elongation of the head, is so very gradual3 the best charac-
teristic is without doubt the presence of maxillae in the Lycoeidoe, but it
is of no value for external examination.

CLAUs’ name Simorlzymfius was changed in 1888 to Simorhynch-
otus by Srssssssmc, because the former name was found to have been
previously applied to a genus of birds.

The species established by CLAUS in 1861 was S.a11tenna1·ius‚
the next new species was S. Lilljeborgi, proposed by me in 1887
(35, p. 34), and here I describe a new species S. Stebbingi.

The three species are easily distinguished, as is shown below.

Α. The head is produced into a short, obtuse rostrum.
The telson is acute at the apex.
a 1. The oute-r ramus of the second pair of
uropoda is about as long as the peduncler l. S. antennarius.
a 2. The outer ramus of the second pair of
uropoda is much shorter than the peduncle. 2. S. Stebbingi.

B. The head is rounded in front, not produced into a
rostrum. The telson is rounded at the apex. 3. S. Lilljeborgi.
