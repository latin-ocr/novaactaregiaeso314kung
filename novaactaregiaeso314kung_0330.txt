not half as long as the tibia, and much shorter than half the inetacarpus.
The seventh pair reach to the apex of the femur of the sixth pair.

The first two pleonal seginents together are almost as long as the
whole peraeon. The lateral parts of all the seginents are rounded below
and obtuse behind.

The first segnient of the 1⁶1¹ch is as long as the last ooalesoed„
which is considerahly shorter than the telson.

The onter ramus of the first pair is narrow⁷ falci-form⁷ the inner
is elongate and sharp-pointed. The rami of the second pair are
narrowly elongate and sharp-pointed, the inner ramus being more than
twice as long and broad as the outcr. The inner ramus of the third

The perceon is much longer than the pleon.
