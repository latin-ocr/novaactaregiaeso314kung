STEBBINGELLA SCLEROTICA. 99

The first pair of sterceapmla have the under side of the carpus
provided with spines, and the hind corner projecting into an
acute apical tooth3 the hind margin of the metaoarpus is
somewhat longer than the under margin of the carpus. The
second pair have the carpus more produced than the first
pair, with the under margin straight and smooth; the hind
margin of the metaearpus is as long as the under margin
of the carpus, and is provided with spines. Along the middle
of the femur of the last three pairs there is a row of four
pits. The seventh pair are shorter than the femur of the sixth.

The pleon is fully as long as the first five peraeonal segments
together; the under margin of the seg-ments is straight3 the
hind corner is produced and sharp-pointed.

The last coalesced mal segment is as long as the telson.

The first pair of zoropoda reaoh to the apex of the last pair.
The rami are laneeolate.

The tel-son is broad, triangular, and reaches beyond the apex
of the last pair of uropoda.

As to the caloareous and peculiarly soulptured integument STREETs
says:

»Animal with the tegumentary eovering hard and resisting — —
—-—-. The thorax elevated along the median line into a broad, rounded
ridge, with the sides sloping down from the summit3 the ridge appearing
somewhat nodulated; a row of nodules along the side above the epime-
rals; on the fifth epimeral a prominent spine, directed baekward; the
segments of the thorax decreasing posteriorly, each segment bulging‚
not overriding its fellow; the whole surfaee of the body finely granulated».

It is very prob-able that the female, which he describes, does not
belong to this species3 it was not taken in the same locality, and it
seems not impossible that it may have been a Cranocefflmlm, since his
description of the granulated and nodulous integument refers to the male
form only.

As to this supposed female he says:

»The female of this speeies is more robust than the male. The
head is deeper and broader, more rounded above and belom the notch
posterior shallower3 the rostrum shorter and narrower. Superior antennae
