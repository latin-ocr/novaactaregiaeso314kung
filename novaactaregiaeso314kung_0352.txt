Diayn. The head is much longer than the whole peraeon, as long as
the peraeon and the first two pleonal segments together3 the
rostrum is fully 38 long 38 the ocular region of the head.

The lower hind corner of the carpus of the second pair of
pet-ceopoda is less produced than in the preceding species.
The femur of the last three pairs is more or less pear-
shaped3 the seventh pair are nearly as long 38 the whole
sixth.

The first pair of uropoclaez reach far beyond the apex of the
second, and to the apex of the last pffir, which are much
shorter than the telson.

Apart from the characteristics recorded iu the diagnosis respecting
the seventh pair of peraeopoda and the relation of the uropoda, the
differences between the two species seem to be very small, or at least
are not easily appreciated owing to the vague description given by STREETS
of his species, and to the want of drawings. The characteristics recorded
above are however sufficient for the distinction of the two species.

For particulars on Calainorhynchus rigidus I refer the reader
to the original description and drawings given by STEBBING.
