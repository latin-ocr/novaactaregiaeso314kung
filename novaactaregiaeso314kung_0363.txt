carpus; the dactylus as in the first pair. The fourth pair
are not longer than the third. The lower hind corner of
the femur of the sixth pair is produced downwards into a
rounded process⁷ which reaches beyond the apex of the genu.
The femur of the seventh pair is inore than half as long
as that of the sixth, and is longer than all the following
joints together.

The pleon is not carinated3 the lateral parts of the segments
are angular behind.

The last coalesced aral segnient is nearly twice as long as
broad at the base⁷ and is quite as long as the telson.

The peduncle of the first pair of zor-opoda is quite as long as
the last ooalesced ural segment‚ and is considerably longer
than the inner ramus.

The telson is elongate-triangular, and is about three times as
long as it is broad as the base.

Streetsia pronoides is distinguished from its congeners by
the very short dactylus of the first two pairs of peraeopoda, and by the
ovate, not posteriorly dilated femur of the seventh pair.

The body is comparatively high and compressed‚ but not carinated.

The hind part of the head is not constricted3 the rostrum seen
from above (p. 23, fig. 9> is narrowly triangular. evenly tapering fron]
the base towards the apex.

The peae‘aeon is comparatively long with high and large epimerals.

The first pair of perceopoda (Pl. HI, fig. 8) have the carpus
longer than broad3 the hind margin is fringed with five or six long
bristles3 the lower corner is obtusely rounded⁷ and shows no teeth on the
hind margin, but has six short and broad triangular teeth on the under
margin, the outermost of which is the broadest and is obtusely round-
ed at the apex3 both sides of the lower hind corner of the joint are
set with a large number of long stout bristles3 the metacarpus is very
broad, scarcely more than a third part longer than broad; the front side
is strongly convex, and fringed with long bristles3 the hind margin forms
a thin edge, bluntly serrated, and bordered by short bristles3 the short
dactylus is smooth on the hind margin. The second pairffl. IlI‚fig. 9)
have the hind margin of the carpus fringed with bristles, as in the first
