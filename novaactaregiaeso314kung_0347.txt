Tmaammmm CUSPIDATA. 69

The last coalesced mal segment is longer than the first, and
about as long as it is broad.

The inner ramus of the third pair of ιινομυάα is coalesced
with the corresponding peduncle.

The telson is broad and triangular, with the sides more or
less curved.

Syn. 1887. Tullbergella, C. BOVALLIUS. 35, p. 38.

Tullbergella is easily distinguished from the other genera of
the family by the not compressed, broad, and robust form of body⁷
the short head and rostrum, and the incomplete seventh pair of peraeo-
poda. In the form of the second pair of antennae it agrees with Simo-
rlzynchotus and Crameeplmlus3 in the form of the first two pairs of peraeo-
poda it resembles Granocepltalus and Stebbinyella.

Hitherto only one species is known.

Diayn. The head is a little longer than the first four peraeonal seg-
ments together. The rostrum is broad, abruptly narrowed
at the apex⁷ and about as long as the hind part of the head,
which is much broader than the base of the rostrum.

The free under margin of the carpus of the first two pairs
of peroeopoda is serrated, armed with bristles, and longer
than the hind margin of the metacarpus. The lower hind
corner of the femur of the sixth pair is produced backwards
into a strong, triangular, sharp-pointed process. The femur
of the seventh pair is more than half as long as that of
the sixth, and more tha-n twice as long as the three follow-
ing joints together. The epimeral of the fifth pair shows
a tuberculous prominence.'

The latera] parts of the pleonal segments are straight and
smooth below; the hind corner of the first two segments is

' angular, that os the third is strongly produced backwards
into a long, triangular, sharp-pointed process, which reaches
beyond the hind margin of the first ural segment.
