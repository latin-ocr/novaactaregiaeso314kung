O. HYPERIIDEA CURVICORNIA.

The first pair of antennae are fixed to the inferior
sicle of the head, they are curved (3), the first joint
of the flagellum is very large, the f‹1›llowing few in
number and subterininal (3). The second pair are

folded (ὅ), or wanting (Q).

1) In my preliminary paper »systematical list of the Arnphipoda Hyperiideam 1 thought it
convenient to place the genus Tryplzoeoza, Α. ΒΟΕΟΚ, in the same family as Dycoea, DANA,and to applyto
the family, containing these two genera and the allies of Lycoea, the name Tryphoem'doe. which preceded
by nine years the family-narne- Lycmicloe, proposed by CLAUS in 1879 in his systematical arrangement
of the Platyscelids. Fui-ther study of ‘these interesting Hyperide has however convinced me that Try-
phaena is more closely allied to the genera Pkorcoraplzis STEBBING, and Isycoeopsis, CLAUS, than to
Dycaea and ‘the other genera placed there by CLAUS. It is principally the peculial· transformation of the
second pair of peraeopoda that makes it desii-able to place Trypho-ma close to the other members ol' the
old family Phorcidoe, beacuse it would be very strange to suppose such a homologous development of
the same organ in genera not closely allied. To this characteristic coine others which also, but not so
thoroughly, point to a closer relation between the three genera, ΡΙιονοοναΡΙιιζς, Lycoeopsz's, and Tryphaena,
as for instance the form of the sixth pair of peraeopoda‚ the sorni of the urus and its appendages, and
in some way the shapo of the first pair of antennae. Fron] the point of view of priority the family-
