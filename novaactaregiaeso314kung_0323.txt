THE FAMm OxYCEPHALmAE. 45

He distinguished the two genera Ooegseeplzalm and Bhabdosoma
from one another by the length of the rostrum and of the uropods.

In 1862 SPENCE ΒΑΤΕ (20, p. 341) made the subfarnily a family
of its own, and in 1885 CARus (33, p. 427) considered it as a subfamily
of the family Platyscelz'doe.

The family OXYGEPHALIDAE, SPENCE ΒΑΤΕ, 1861.

Diayn. The lzeacl is more or less elongated and rostrate.

The eyes are large, but do not occupy the whole head.

The first pair of antennae are curved (ὅ), and fixed on the
under side of the head; the first joint of the flagellum is
very large, and tumid; the following, joints are small, few
in number, and subterminalffl). The second pair are fixed
on the under side of the head, are long, slender, and folded
four times (ῤ’), or are entirely wanting (ὃ).

The mouth-myrtus are reduced, the maxillae being rudimentary;
the mandibles are provided with an elongated palp (ὃ), or
without a palp (9).

The last five pairs of perceopoda are walking legs; the femur
of the last three pairs is not transformed. The seventh pair
are complete. The ovitectrices are well developed.

The uropoda are provided with rami.

The telsmz is coalesced with the last ural segment.

In 1887, in my preliminary »Systematical list» I enumerated five
genera, in addition to Rlzabclosoma or Xiplzoceplzalus, as composing the
family Oxyeephalidae‚ viz: Glossocephalus‚ Oxycephalus‚ Lepto-
cotis, Tullbergella‚ and Calamorhynchus3 a sixth genus Streetsia,
was proposed in 1888 by STEBBING3 and here I increase the number of
genera to ten by transferring the genus Simorhynchotus from the
Lycoeidae to this family7 and by introducing three new genera, viz: Ora-
nocephalus‚ Stebbingella‚ and Dorycephalus

Of these genera Sim orhynchotus shows some relation to
Lyeaez‘doe, Tullbergella to Euthamneidae, Cranocephalus and Steb-
bingella to Eutyphidce‚ Glossocephalus to Plzoreoraplzz'doe, and Dory-
cephal‘us and Leptocot.is to Xiphoeeplzalz'sloe.

These ten genera may be distinguished by the characteristics
shown in the following synoptical table:
