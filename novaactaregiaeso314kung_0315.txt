the form of a club or a mushroom, the head armed with short, strong,
retroverted teeth‚ their purpose being to hold the two pleopods to-
gether (fig. 66—69). The rami of the pleopoda are also very similar

The first large joint of the inner ramus carries a »cleft bristle» (fig.
68—70), also first noticed by Gr. O. SARs and minutely described by
Stebbing from many different forms of the ))Ohallenge1·)) Amphipoda.
The following joints are provided each with one pair of feathered

bristles.

70. The m’us and its appendaqes.

The first segment of the urus is usually short, much shorter than
the last pleonal segment‚ except in Xiphocephalus in Which it is much
elongated, rod-like, and longer than the last- pleonal segment. The
second and third segments are coalesced into one, and usually longer
than the first segmenti, the only exception being Xipho ceph alus ar-
matus, in which the coalesced last ural segmentis shorter than the first.
The last coalesced segment is comparatively broad in Simorhynchotus
(fig. 76), Tullbergella (fig. 74), Glossocephalus (fig. 71), and steb-
bingella, more elongated in Oranocephalus (fig. 72), Oxycephalus
(fig. 75), Streetsia, Dorycephalus (fig. 73) Leptocotis, and Cala-
morhynchus, and lastly very narrow and rod-like in Xiphocephalus.

The telson is invariably coalesced with the last ural segment in
all the genera of the Oxycephalidae, and this character not only
suggests the relation of the Oxycephalidae with the Lyc‘cez'sloe, the Para-
