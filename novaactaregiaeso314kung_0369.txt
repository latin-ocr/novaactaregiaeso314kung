magnifying power, shows traces of a very minute serration consisting
of densely placed rounded teeth3 the apex of the hind margin projects
a little along t'he dactylus into a broadly rounded process; the dactylus
is short, with the hind margin entirely smooth. The second pair (p.
33, fig. 55) have the stem of the carpus as long as broad; the hind
margin is fringed with five or six long bristles3 the carpal process is
broadly triangular, not outdrawn into an apical spine-like tooth; the front
margin is entirely smooth, and without spines; the sides ot the joint and
of the process show an oblique row of long bristles3 the metacarpus is
comparatively narrow; the front margin isconvex, the hind is straight
and smooth, not forming a distinct edge, the dactylus is fully half as
long as the metacarpus, with the hind margin smooth. The fifth pair
are much longer than the sixth; the femur is about twice as long as
broad, with the lower hind corner produced downwards into a broadly
rounded process reaching to the apex of the genu3 the femur is shorter
than the three following joints together. The sixth pair have the fe-
mur about as long as all the following joints together3 the apical process
is broadly rounded, and reaches sully to the apex ef the genu; the front
margin of the tibia is fringed with longer and shorter spine—like t-eeth, one
long one and one short one alternating (Pl. III, fig. 5). The seventh pair
are very long, reaching nearly to the apex of the tibia of the sixth pair; the
femur is broad, scarcely a third part longer than broad, with the upper hind
portion dilated; it is a little longer than all the following joints together.

The pleon is as long as the first five peraeonal segments together.
The hind corner of the pleonal segments is not produced baokvvards,
but is angular.

The first pair of wopoda (Pl. III, fig. 6) reach almost to the
apex of the last pair3 the peduncle is linear, nearly five times as long
as broad, and more than a third part longer than the inner ramus3 the
inner ramus is elongate-lanceolate, serrated on both margins, and is longer
than the outer ramus, which is elongated, sharp-pointed, smooth on the
outer margin and serrated on the inner. The second pair reach nearly
to the middle of the inner ramus of the last pair3 the peduncle is much
broader than that in the first pair, and not fully three times as long as
broad; the inner lower corner is a little projecting, and sharp-pointed, as in
the first pair; the inner ramus is only a little longer than the peduncle,
lanceolate, serrated on both margins, and is considerably longer than, and
not fully twice as broad as, the outer ramuS‚ which is serrated on the inner
margin, and smooth on the outer. The third pair reach as far as four-
