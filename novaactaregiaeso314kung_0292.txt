characteristics used by DANA, only a relative quantity though it is true
that it is carried to the extreme point in the Eatyplzidoe. The third is a
good characteristic for distinguishing the Eutgyplzicloe and the Scelz'dce from
the Ooeyceplzalidw and the Plzorez‘doe, but. unhappily the Pmnoidae, and some
forms of the Lycoeidoe are intermediate. The fourth is, in my opinion,
very uncertain and liable to sexual variation. The fifth is a valuable
characteristic for distinguishing the family Eutyphz'doe from the family See-
lidoe, but it is difficult to use it in exterual examination.

After a long study of the different forms of the Amphipoda Hy-
periidea I have arrived at the conviction that there are a number of char-
acteristics, little or not at all appreciated by previous authors, but useful
for the distinction of subtribes, families and genera within the tribe
Amphipoda Hyperifflea, of them I quote the most important here.

According to these characteristics I propose to divide the Hype-
rids into three subtribes: —

Ι. Hyperiidea recticornia.
Diayn. The first pair of antennae are fixed at the anterior part

of the head, they are straight, the first joint· of the flagellum is
large, the following few in number and terminal.

Π. Hyperiidea filicornia.
Diay‘n. The first pair of antennae are fixed at the anterior part
of the head, they are straight, the first joint of the flagellum is
large, the following many in number (3), filiform and terminal.

III. Hyperiidea curvicornia.
Diafflz. The first pair of antennae are fixed at the inferior part
of the head, they are curved (ὅ), the first joint of the flagellum
is very large, the following few in number and subterminal (ὅ).
