Diayn. The head is as long as the peraeon and the first pleonal seg-
ment together3 the rostrum is not fully as long as the rest

of the head.

The perform is dorsally oarinated.

The under margin of the carpus ofthe first pair ofperaeopodais
strongly sem-ared, with short, broad teeth, and has the hind
corner projeoting into a long sharp tooth3 the hind margin
of the metaoarpus is smooth, and is longer than the under
margin of the oarpus; the dactylus is more than half as long
as the metaoarpus. The second pair are almost oheliform,
with the front margin of the oarpal process smooth and ending
into a broad sharp tooth; the hind margin of the metaoarpus
is armed with a few short⁷ broad teeth, andis about as long
as the front margin of the oarpal process with the apioal
tooth; the dactylus is more than half as long as the meta—
carpus. The fourth pair are a little longer than the third.
The lower hind corner of the femur of the sixth pair is
produced downwards into a long rounded process, which
reaches far beyond the apex of the genu. The femur of
the seventh pair is not half as long as that of the sixth,
and is much shorter than all the following joiuts together.

The pleon is dorsally oarinated3 the lateral parts of the seg-
ments are rounded behind.

The last coalesoed aral segment is about a third part longer
than broad⁷ and is quite as long as the telson.

The peduncle of the first. pair of uropoclcz is short-er than the
last ooalesoed ura] segment‚ and is as long as the inner
ramus.

The telson is lanceolata, and is about three times as long as
broad.

Stre etsia carinata is easily distinguished from the other spe-
cies by tho peraeon and pleon being dorsally carinated, and the femur
of the seventh pair of peraeopoda considerably much shorter than all
the following joints together.
