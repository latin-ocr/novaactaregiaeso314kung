122 CARI. BOVALLms, THE OXYCEPHALIDS.

tion contained no characteristics of use for the specific distinction. He
asserted further that only the fifth and sixth pairs of peraeopoda were pro-
vided with branchial vesicles, while, as I have shown above, the second,
third, and fourth pairs also have such appendages⁷ but as they are
usually concealed by the projecting laterai parts of the peraeonal seg-
ments, i. e. the coalesced epimerals, they may easily escape notice.

In 1887 Ι gave 21 short diagnosis of Rlzabdorzectes armatus, H.

MILNE Emmaus, with characteristics fully sufficient to distinguish it
from R. Whitez'.

Among the »ChallengerD specimens of Xiphocephalids there seem
to be none belonging to the present species.

The body is much compressed‚ and is only a little broader in
the female than in the male. The integumenti is very thiu, but hard,
almost vitreous7 and perfectly smooth. ,Ι

The head, without the rostrum, is not fully as long as the peraeon.
The neck is about a fourth part longer than the ocul-ar region. The
rostrum is four or five times longer than the rest of the head, needle-
shaped, with two marginal, serrated ridges 011 the under side3 the apex
of the rostrum is sharp-pointed. The rostrum is rather longer in the
adult female than .in the male. The antennal groove is large in the male,
forming a protruding convexity in front of the ocular region; in the female
it is less spacious‚ and is not visible on the dorsal side of the head.

The first pair of antennae in the male (Pl. VI, fig. 3> are like
that pair in Ooeyceplzalz'cloe‚ having the second and third pedunclar joints
almost fused and the last three joints of the flagellum together not half
as long as the under margin of the first> flagellat· joint. In the young
male the first pair are very like that in the young of Ooeyceplzalus
piscator. In the female this pair (Pl. VI, fig. 4) consist of a two-jointed
peduncle, and a long single flagellarjoint, which is almost spindle—shaped⁷
and set with long olfactory hairs. The second pair in the adult male
reach, when folded, to the front wall of the ant-ennal groove3 the joints
are straight, and have the under margin fringed with short hairs.

The mandibles are comparatively small, and wanta inola1·tubercle;'
the mandibular palp in the male is very long⁷ its first joint beingalittle
longer than the first joint of the second pair of antennae; the second
and third joints ave very short⁷ subequal in length.
