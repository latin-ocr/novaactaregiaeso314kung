In Tullbergella (fig. 27> and Stebbingella (fig. 3> the integu-

tubereles, fine notches, serolls and grooves; in Oxyoephalus(fig.4) the
integument 18 1111111181, sometimes forming longer or shorter longitudinal
and transverse] keels or folds, but these keels are only angulated eleva-

The colour 18 very variable, red, yeHOW, green, and white; many
species are entirely hyaline. Only in Tullbergella cuspidata, and
in Xiphooephalus Whitei, have Ι observed larger pigment-eells, or
chromatophors of some kind, of more or 1888 regular star-like form. There
