the same length as the second. The extremities of the first four joints
are dilated‚ showing powerful muscles plumosely arranged. In Stebbing-
ella the antenna] joints are much bent (fig. 30) but in the other genera
. they are more or less straight. The fifth joint, or in Glossocephalus
the fifth and sixth joints are very short (fig. 31). The margins of all
the joints are fringed with minute hairs.

7. The mouth-oryans.

These organs are less developed in the Oxycephalids than in most
of the other Hyperide. In the genus Xiphocephalus (fig. 32) the
epi-§tonza forms a ronnded, shield-like plate, with a strongly protruding,

central, spine-like process. In the true Oxycephalidae it consists of a tu-

berculous prominence in front of the mouth-organs.

The labrum (fig. 33) is more or less distinctly bilobed‚ the hind
margin feebly curved, and almost entirely smooth.

The mamlibles (fig. 34—39) are best developed in the genera
Tullbergella and Glossocephalus‚ and most simple in the genus

Xiphocephalus. In the first genus the right mandible has a large,
straight, cutting or incisive process with a broad neck springing out from
the somewhat elongated stem of the mandible3 on the left mandible there
is also an accessory process not half as wide as the principal. In
Xiphocephalus the mandibles are less elongated than in the Oxyce-
