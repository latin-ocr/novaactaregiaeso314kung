the telson and the last ura] segineut. The likeness between the Xipleoce-

phaliclce and the Caprellids, suggested by previous authors, is very super—
ficial and is no reasn for placing the Xiphoeephalz'dce last in the tribe¹).

C. characterismos for the distinction of the Genera among the·
OXYOEPHALIDS.

1. The ⁸qeneral form of the head and the rostrum.

2. Thefirst pair ofperceopoda being] simple, — subclcelzform, — or clzelzform.

3. lee second pair of perceopoda being] subcheliform, — or ehelzfoo'm.

4. The inner rami of the second ancl third pairs of mopoda coalesced
with the correspondiny peclancles, - οφ free.

5. The vrelation between the length of the ‘m‘al seymentS.
These five characteristics are sufficient for the distinction of the
genera given here below as constituting the family Ooeyeephalicloe.

D. characterismos for the distinction of the Species of the
OXYCEPHALIDEAN GENERA.

These characteristics vary of course much in the different genera⁷
but a few which are very useful and of common occurence may be
pointed out here.

1. The armature of the first two pairs of perseopoda.

2. The seventh pair of perceopoda.

3. lee relation between the onter ancl ‘inner rami of the uropoda.
4. The relation between the telson and the last aral seyment.

Within the genus Xiphocephalus particularly the following good
specific characteristics may be indicated:
i. The form of the epz'meral of the first pair of perceopoda.
2. The form of the lateral parts of the seventh perceonal segyment.
3. The relation between the lenyflz of the first two pairs of uropoda.
4. The relation between the last pair of uropoda and the telson.
