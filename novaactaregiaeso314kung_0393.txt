XwnocerALlDAE. 115

The ⁴ztropoda are provided with rami.
The telson is not coalesced with the last nral segment').

Characteristic features of this family, in addition to those given
in the diagrmsis, are the cnornious development of the auditory vesicles
in the hind part of the hezich the not less highly developed glands in some
of the joints of the peraeopoda (sce above, p. 42), and also the peculiar
manner of bearing and protecting the eggs and young ones (see above p.
31 and 43). The most striking among the exter-nal characteristics is the
extreme elongation of the head and the urus, with its appendages⁷ but
notwithstanding this there are very few details showing analogies with
the other elongated forms of Amphipoda⁷ viz: Tanaialea and Caprellidea.

The first description of an animal belonging to this family was
published in 1840 by H. MnANE EDWARDs (7, see above p. 3). In the
following year Emoux and SOULEYET (8, p. 267) gave a detailed descrip-
tion of an Oxycephalid‚ which they supposed to be identical with the
anceplealns armatas of H. MILNE EnwARns. The drawing which
they gave, is the first we have of a Xiphocephalid‚ and in execution
has not been rivalled to this day3 a copy of it in reduced scale is given
, below (Pl. VII, fig. 1). 111 the work of these authors we also find the
first recognition of the animal in question as the type for an indepen-
dent genus. According to their statement it was F. E. Gm'fllnN-MENEVILLE,
who proposed the new generic name Xiphocephalus. He did not give
a full diagnosis, it is true, but the identity of the genus there was no
possibility of mistaking‚ as the description of the species was exhaustive,
and the accoinpanying drawing excellent, as I have mentioned above.
Fron] this gcneric name the present family—name has been taken.

 

An exception is X'iplzoeephalus breesemalatus, ΤΗ. Smssssma.
