40 CARI, BOVALLms, THE OXYGEPHALIDS.

The outer and the inner ramus are usually both well developed,
and more or less equal in length. Exceptions from this are Dory-
cephalus Lindstroemi (fig. 77), Xiphocephalus armatus (fig. 80)
and X. brevieaudatus. In the first of which the outer rami of the
first and third pairs and in the two latter those of all the ‘three pairs
are very reduced in size, diminutive.

Usually we have well developed ,ulands in the peduncles and
rami3 their outlets are usually situated at the upper end of the rami,
where the rami are in contact with one another. In Xiphocephalus
