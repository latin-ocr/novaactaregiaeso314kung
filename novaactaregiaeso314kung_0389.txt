LEPToco'ms. 111

more nearly cheliform than in Doryceplzalus; the best distinguishing cha-
racteristic is, however, the considerable elongation of the urus and its
appendages. But by this last characteristic Leptocotis mz'ndanaonis, S'rssss-
BING, is clearly excluded from the genus, and if it be not placed in the

genus Streetsia, as Ι think it may be, and have already suggested (above
p. 81), it ought to be the type for a new genus.

The generic diagnosis given by Smssffrs in 1877 contains only
a few passages which could possibly serve for characterization of his
new genus. They are:

»Gnathopoda short and complexly chelate. — -- ——. Caudal ap-
pendages long, biramous. Telson cylindrical, long».

In 1878 he gave the following diagnosis:

»Body long and slender. Head produced anteriorly to the superior
antennae in a long, slcnder rostrum, constricted posteriorly at its arti-
culation with the thorax, the constricted portion short. Superior antennae
short, three-jointed, curved in the male3 inferior antennae five-jointed,
joints subeqmal, excepting the last which is short. Mandibular append-
age three-jointed. First and second pairs of thoi-acic legs short, chelate3
the third and fourth simple} the last three pairs with the basa] joint
dilated3 the last pair diminutive. The sixth abdomina] segment (the fifth

and sixth fused) elongated. The candal appendages long, linear. Telson
long, triangular at apex».

Whether Oaeyceplzalus tenuirostrz's, CLAUS, and Leptocotis spini—
fera, STREETS, are identical or not is a very difficult question to settle,
because the authors do not record at all, or only vaguely, any details of
importance for specific distincti0n3 Ι must therefore 1·est1·ictmyself to

giving the two species below with the characteristics which are available
from their descriptions.

Diayn. The head, without the rostrum, is as long as the whole

peraeon; the rostrum is slightly more than half as long as
the rest of the head.

The segments of the perceon increase in length backwards. The
epimerals are long, broadly ovate, and transversely rugose.
