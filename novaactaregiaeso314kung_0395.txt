XIPnocssPnALUs. 117

our specimen we cannot describe this, but indicate it on the plato from
a drawing made at the time of capture. The immense length of the
body and the beak would sufficiently marl< this generic form».

On the same typical specimen on which AnAMs and WmTr: had
founded the genus Rlzalnloxoma, SPENCE Birra inv 1858 founded his genus
Macrocephalus. Four years later he himself dropped the new name in
favour of Rlzabdosoma.

In 1840 H. Mam: EDWARDS (7, p. 101) described Ooeyceplzalus ar-
matus with characteristics fully sufficient for the identification of the spe-
cies. The Owyceplcalns armatus, which was described at length by EYDon
and Somfflym (8, p. 267-71) 16 1101 identical with ΜιιΝΕ EDWARDs’ species,
but with that subsequently instituted by Spssmcn BATE (see below p. 127).

The Rlzabclosoma armatum, ADAMS and Wfflm, is a true Xip h o cep ha-
lus armatus, as is of course also Macrocephalus Commi-ostris, SPENCE ΒΛΤΕ,
the two names really having been given to the same specimen.

The Rlzabdosoma leitei, SPENCE ΒΑΤΕ, 16 6 good species, and the
characteristics given by its founder, are quite adequate.

The Rhabdosoma armatum and Rh. Wltitezg recorded in 1878 by
STREETs, are 1116 true species⁷ but his Rla„ lonyirostre is based only on
the bad drawing of SPENCE ΒΑΊῈ from ADAMS and WH1Ts⁷s typical spe-
cimen of Xiphocephalus armatus (see below p. 121).

The Rhabdosoma armatum, described by CLAUS in 1879 and 1887,
is a mixture of the two species just metioned, the male being Xipho-
cephalus Whitei‚ and the female X. armatus.

The Rhabdosoma Batai, figured in 1884 by J. S. KINGSLEY (32,
fig. 98), is a synonym for Xiphocephalus armatus.

The Rhabdosoma investiyatoris, proposed in 1887 by G. M. G1LES
(37, p. 219), 16 identical with Xiphocephalus Whitei (see below p. 127).

The Rhabdosoma armatum, recorded in 1888 by S'rnssmue, is a
Xiphocephalus Whitei. His new species, th. brevicaudacum, seems
to be a good species.

Here Ι propose 6 new species Xiphocephalus Lilljeborgi.
