DORYCEPHALUS LmnsrROEMl. 77

mens, l have not ventured to unite the two species under one name,
though I was at first much disposed to do so,

The body is more compressed and slender than in the genus
Ooeyeephalus, the thin integument shows, especially on the perae‹›n, small
pits and excavations, round, or oblong, or s-shaped, probably occupied
by cutaneous glands.

The rostrum is considerably longer than a third part of the length
of the whole head. The ocular region is more evenly egg-shaped in the
female than in the male.

The first pair of antennoe in the male have the lower front corner
of the first flagellar joint produced into a narrowly conical process, which
is as long as the breadth of the joint. The last three flagellar joints
together are scarcely as long as a third part of the under margin of the
first j0int; the second joint is as long as the third, the fourth is a little
longer than the first, and is very slender. The second pair in the male
have the first three joints almost equal in length; the fourth is a little
shorter than the third, but is twenty-four times as long as the fifth or
last joint (p. 27, fig. 31).

The first pair of peroeopoda (p. 33, fig. 56) have the femur
nearly as long as the four following joints together; the lower margin
of the tibia is finely serrated; the carpus is only a little produced, with
the under margin sparingly serrated; the front margin of the meta-
carpus is strongly convex, the hind margin is straight forming an edge,
which is serrated only at the lower corner, with six or seven spine-like
teeth; the dactylus is short, curved, with a small tooth on the hind
margin, and is a third part as long as the metacarpus. The second pair
(Pl. II, fig. 17> have the carpus more produced than in the first pair, but
still the carpal process is not half as long as the stem of the joint, and
the prehensile organ, formed by the carpus and metacarpus, must be
termed a subcheliform hand3 the metacarpus is considerably shorter
than the stem of the carpus; its hind margin is provided with four
shallow notches rather than serrated, and has five or six spine-like teeth
at the lower corner. The third and fourth pairs are very slender,
the metacarpus of both pairs is a trifle shorter than the tibia. The fifth
pair have the femur quite as long as the three followingjoints together;
the apex is outdrawn behind the genu almost to the apex of that joint;
the tibia is much longer than the metacarpus, which is twice as long
as the dactylus. The sixth pair have the femur fully as long as, and
