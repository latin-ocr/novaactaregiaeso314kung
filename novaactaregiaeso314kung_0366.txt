The hind part of the head is not constricted3 the rostrum seen
from above (Pl. IV, fig. 2) 18 elongate-lanceolam.

The epham-als are not as high as in the preceding species.

The first pair of perceopoda (Pl. ΙΙΙ, fig. 13> have the carpus
longer than broad, with the under margin somewhat convex3 the hind
margin has a single bristle; the lower corner projccts into a strong,
narrow 100111, and shows five or six sharp broad teeth 011 1116 hind margin
above the apical tooth3 the two undermost teeth are much longer than
the others; the under margin shows four broad. triangular teeth in front
of the large apical tooth; the metacarpus has 1116 same form as in the
preceding species⁷ but is nearly twice as long as broad3 the dactylus is
curved‚ and armed with a small tooth on the hind margin a little below
the middle. The second pair (Pl. III, fig. 14) have the carpus pro-
duced so as to form with the metacarpus an almost cheliform hand⁷
though it is really only a subcheliform hand, because the metacarpus
does not impinge upon the apex of the carpal process but passes
across the inside of it, the edge of the metacarpus and the sharp front
margin of the carpal process meeting one another like the blades of a
pair of scissors3 the dactylus is like that in the first pair. The fifth
pair are much longer than the sixth3 the femur is twice as long as broad,
and quite as long as the three following joints together. The sixth
pair have the femur a little shorter than all the following joints to-
gether. The seventh pair (p. 34, fig. 58> are about as long as the femur
of the sixth3 the femur is almost triangular, with the margins feebly
convex, and is not sully twice as long as it is broad at the base; it is
scarcely longer than the three following joints together.

The pleon is as long as the first five peraeonal segments together.
The hind corner of the third segment is produced backwards‚ and is
broadly rounded.

The first pair of zaropocla (Pl. ΙΙΙ, fig. 15) reach a little beyond
the middle of the inner ramus of the last pair3 the peduncle is linear,
and about five times as long as broad3 the inner ramus is elongate-
lanceolate, serrated on both marginS, with spine-like 166111, and is conside-
rably longer than the outer ramus, which is elongat-ed, somewhat curved,
smooth on the outer margin, and serrated on the inner. The second
pair reach to the middle of the inner ramus of the last pair3 the ped-
uncle is as long as the inner ramus, which is broader, and much longer,
than the outer; both rami are serrated as in the first pair. The third
pair reach 68 far as five-sixths of the length of the telson; the peduncle
