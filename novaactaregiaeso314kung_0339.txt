OXYQEPHALUS CLAusi. 61

The species is at once distinguished from its congeners by the
raised, almost prismatic dorsal sections of the peraeonal segments, by the
strongly protruding heel of the carpus of the second pair of peraeopoda,
by the almost circular femur of the sixth pair, and by the tooth-like,

&K sharp-pointed projections on the under margins of the pleonal segments.

N The head (p. 522, fig. 7 and 8) is longer in the male than in the
female, especially the hind part of it. On the upper side the. median
line forms a distinct keel, ending in the apex, which is feebly bent down-
wards. The under margins of the rostrum are seri-ated. In the male
the head is as long as the first six peraeonal segments together, in the
female as long as the first four.

The first pair of ‹mtennoe are like those in the preceding species,
but the last three joints of the flagellum are not longer than the breadth
of the first flagellar joint3 the second is quite as long as the third, but
much thicker.

The first pair of perceoporla (Pl. L fig. 21) have the carpus very
broad, with the lower front corner forming a broad angular heel at the base
of the metacarpus; the carpal process is like that in the preceding species,
but. more strongly serrated and shorter than the hind margin of the meta-
carpus; the hind margin forms a thin, strongly serrated edge, the lower
corner of which is angular. The second pair (p. 33, fig. 54) are much
longer and stouter than the first pair; the carpus, without the process,
is only a fourth part longer than the metacarpus, the lower front
corner forms a broader heel than in the first pair; the carpal process is
bluntly sex-rated, and reaches almost to the apex of the dactylus. The
femur of the fifth pair is ovate, coarsely serrated on the front margin,
and considerably shorter than the three'following joints together. The
sixth pair (Pl. I, fig. 23) are much shorter than the fifth; the femur is
very broad, almost circular‚ serrated along the margins, and fully a third
part broader than that of the fifth pair; the carpus is a little more than
half as long as the tibia, with a row of longer and shorter spines along
the front margin, one long one and four short ones alternating; the dac-
tylus is serrated on the front margin. The seventh pair (Pl. I, fig. 24)
reach fully to the apex of the carpus of the sixth pair; the femur is
about as long as that of the preceding pair, and a little more than half
as broad; it is longer than all the following joints together.

The pleon in the male is as long as the last six peraeonal seg-
ments together; in the female it is as long as the last five. The latei-al
