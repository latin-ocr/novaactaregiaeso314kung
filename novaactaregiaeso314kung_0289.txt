HisrochL No'rns. 11

Lastly I have to mention the splendid work of the Rev. 'Pnoims
R. R. STEBBING, 39, on the »Challengfflw Amphipoda, published at the end of
last year, in the bibliographical part of which the accomplished author
gives us many valuable hints concerning the synonymy of the Oxyce-
phalidean genera and species, and in the second half of the descrip-
tive part of wich he most accurutely sets forth the characteristics of the
species obtained during the celebrated »Challengew Expedition. The
descriptions are accompanied by magnificent plates. He describes the
following genera and species, Oxycephalus Clausi, C. BOVALLIUS,
Omyeeplzalus porcellus7 Chim& Ο. ίοφη]ἱ6ι]]).ς, CLAUs7 the last two below
being named Streetsia porcellus, Ulmus, and S. longiceps, CLAU53
Leptocotis ambobus, n. sp.7 synonyinous with Do ryce p h al u s Lin (Istro mi.
C. BOVALLms, as will be proved below; Leptocotis mindanaonis, n.
sp.; Calamorhynchus rigidus, n. sp.; Streetsia n.g.‚ with the new
species S. challengeri3 Rhabdosoma armatum, H. Mam: EDWARDS, of
which he with some doubt quotes leli. l‘Vlzitei as a synonym7 and lastly
the new species Rlz. brevieamlatmn. The name Simorlzynclzus, CLAUs, is
changed into Silnorhynchotus. n. n.7 and he places this genus in the
family Lycsez'dw.

In this treatise I propose to distinguish the Oxycephalidae7
SPENCE BATE and the Xiphocephalidae as two separate fainilies⁷ and
my reasons sor doing so will be given below3 Ifurther think it necessary
to transfer the genus Simorhynchotus, S'rEBB1NG‚f1-0n1 the Tryplzaenz'doe
to the Oxyoephalidae, in order to get uniformity in the generic cha-
racters; in this latter family I remove Ooeyceplzalus porcellus, CLAUS‚ O,
pronoides, O. BovALLms, Ο. lonyz'eeps, Omns, and O. Steemrupi‚ O. Bo-
VALL1us, from the genus Oxycephalus, sensu stricto, to STEBmNG's new
genus Streetsia3 for the reception of O. typlzoides‚ Omns, O. solero-
tiens, STREETS, and a new species with the specific name Theeli7I pro-
pose the new genus Stebbingella. For Leptoeotis Limlstrc'imi the new
genus Dorycephalus is instituted. A hitherto undescribed Oxycephalid
is the type for the new genus Cranocephalus, with the specific
name O. GOESL The names Rlcabclosomffl ADAMS and WHrrE, and Rhab-
donectes, O. BovALLms, are dropped in favour of the generic name Xi-
phocephalus, proposed by Gussnm as early as in 1841 to this genus
a new species X. Lilljeborgi is added.
