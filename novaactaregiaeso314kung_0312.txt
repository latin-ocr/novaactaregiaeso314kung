34 CARL BOVALLms, THE OXYCEPHALIDS.

None of the following pairs of legs are prehensile in any of 1116
adult forms of the genera dealt within this treatise. The seventh pair are
complete in all 1116 genera of the Oxycephalidae (fig. 58) with 1116 excep-
11011 of Tullbergella (fig. 59), in which the carpus and metacarpus
are fused together⁷ a feature closely resembling that which occurs in the
families I'z'bz'lz'dae and Cffllopodidcoe among 1116 Hesperiidea recticornz'cz, and a
feature 3160 suggesting 1116 relation of 1116 Oxycephalidae with 1116
Pronoidce. In Xip ho cephalidae 1116 6611611111 pair are transformed (fig. 47).

femur is narrowest, almost linear, in all 1116 legs 111 1116 Xiphocephalidae.
In the Oxycephalidae the senun- 01”1116 third and fourth pairs is usu-
