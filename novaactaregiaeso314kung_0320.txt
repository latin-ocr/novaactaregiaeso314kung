consisting of only one cell, with a short, narrow duct opening into a small
circular hole in the surface of the integument (fig. 83), which hole is usually
guarded by one or more small simple hai1·s; or they are composed of many
cells, and packed into thick masses round a central lumen from which a com-
mon duct runs to the outlet. The outlet is often placed, as mentioned above,
at the base of the dactylus (fig. 84), more seldom at its apex (fig. 65), often in
semicircu lar incisions at the upper end of the rami of the uropoda, or — as
in Xipho cephalus -— at the apex of the telson and of the rami of the uro-
poda (fig. 81 and 82). Usually the
glands of the legs are concen-
trated in the femur, and only a
few and scattered glandular cells
are to be seen within the follo-
wing joints, often lying round or
close to the duct which runs from

the chief mass of glands in the
femur to the base of the dac-
tylus (fig. 84); but in the fema-
les of the three species of Xi-
plzoceplzalus which I have exa-
mined, the tibia and carpus of
the third and fourth pairs of
peraeopoda, as well as the same
joints of the fifth and sixth pairs

mass surrounding the axis of the joint for the whole of its length
(fig. 85). The development of these powerful glands in the tibia and
carpus of those pairs of peraeopoda is, however, in my opinion periodic-
al, and may be supposed to have some connection with the fixation of
the eggs on the under-side of the body, so I venture the supposition
that they are cement-glands. I believe this enormous development
of the tibial and carpal glands to be periodical because Ι have
seen fullgrown females of X. armatus and X. Whitei without the
joints in question inflated at all; but Ι have never seen females of the
same species with eggs or young ones, which had not at the same
time those joints more or less infiated. Thus it seems probable that. the
development of these glands may be connected with the maternal functions
