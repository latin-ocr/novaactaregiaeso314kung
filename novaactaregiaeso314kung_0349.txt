TULLBERGELLA CUSPIDATA. 71

The perceonal segments are somewhat convex transversely; the
surface is slightly rugose, being thiekly set with small nobs or tubercles
(p. 26, fig. 27).

The first pair of perseopoda (p. 32, fig. 51) are a little shorter
than the second; the femur is linear, and narrow; the carpus is nearly
square, somewhat narrowed at the base, and not produced3 the under
free margin is finely sei-rated, bordered with short bristles‚ and is a
little longer than the hind margin of the metacarpus‚ which forms a
thin serrated edge, with simple teeth3 the dactylus is smooth, and not
fully half as long as the met-acarpus. The second pair (Pl, II, fig.13>
are similar ‘to the first in shape, but the serrat-ion on the hind margin
of the metacarpus consists of larger, finely denticulated teeth. The
third and fourth pairs are comparatively slender, and much shorter
than the fifth pair3 the femur is narrow, linear, and not broader than the
following joints The fifth pair have the femur fully as broad as that
of the sixth, almost ovate, With the lower front corner a little produced;
it is consideraby shorter than the three following joints together. The
sixth pair (p. 35, fig. 61) are much shorter than the fifth3 the lower
hind corner of the femur is produced into a broad, triangular, sharp-
pointed process, which is a little more than half as long as the breadth
of the femur; the femur is about as long as the three following joints
together. The seventh pair are incomplete, consisting of only the femur,
genu, tibia, and carpus3 all the joints are provided with glands; the
femur is fully as broad as, and about a third part shorter than, that of
the sixth pair; it is more than twice as long as all the following joints
together.

The pleon is about as long as the last six peraeonal segments
together. The lateral, sharp-pointed process of the last pleonal segment
(p. 38, fig. 74) does not reach fully to the middle of the last coalesced
ural segment.

The first ural segment is more than half as long as the last
coalesced, which is about a fourth part broader than long, and a little
longer than the telson.

The first pair of uropoda (p. 38, fig. 74) reach fully to the
apex of the last pair, and a little beyond the apex of the telson;
the peduncle is shorter than the inner ramus, Which is a trifle
shorter than the outer, both being elongate-lanceolam, sharp-pointed,
and serrated. The second pair do not fully reach to the apex of the
last pair; the peduncle is shorter than the rami, which are equal in
