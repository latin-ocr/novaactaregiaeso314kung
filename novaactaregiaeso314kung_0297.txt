name Tryphoem‘doe ought to be applied to the family thus composed, bnt as it has been used as a sy-
nonym for Lycoez'dae by myself and by STEBBING it would make confusion in the synonymy. 1 therefore
prefer to nse a family-name derived from the new form given by STEBBING to the old generic name
Phor-cm, which was found to be preoccupied. To maintain, as does S'PEBBING. the family-name Plaorcidoe,
when the generic name Phorcus is rejected, is not convenient as the family-name must refer to a generic
name in use within the family.

1 have also divided the old family Tryphaenidae into two, Euthamneidoe — comprising the
iwo genera Thamyris. SPENCE BATE, (or Braeleyscelus, according to STEBBING) and Euthamneus, (the
former name Thamneus being thus modilied to avoid confusion) — and Lyeoez'dae, CLAUS, - restricting
it to the two genera Lycoea, DANA. and Pseudolyeaea, CLAUS. Of the old members of the family Try-
phemiam, as it was composed in my paper, which Ι have just referred to,I have thus placed Tryphoe‘na
in the family Plzorcoraphz'doe5 Paralycaea in the Pronoz'cloe* (this transposition was really done in 1887
but owing to a typographiam error it stands into »Systematieal list» with its number fron] Pronoz'dae
among the Tryphoenidae); lemnyrz's and Eutha-mneus in the new family Euclmmneidce3 Lycoea and Pseu-
dolyeaea in the Lyeaeidae: and lastly Simorhynclwtus in the Oxyceplzalz'dae.

1) Α very pnzzling exception to this rule is Rhahczosoma brevicazcclatmn, described by STEBBING
(l. c. p 1612, pl. 208). He says namely that the telson is coalesced with the last ural segment and
much shorter ‘than this segment, broadly rounded and peetinate at the apex, bnt all these statements
are strikingly opposed to my experienee which is founded upon the examination of many specimens of the
two old species, Xiphocephalus armatus and X. Whitei. I for my part am much inclined to

believe that the single specimen which was the type for the new species proposed by STEBfflNG, may
have been abnormal, perhaps injured.
