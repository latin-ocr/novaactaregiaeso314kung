108 CARI, BovALLrus, THE OXYCEPHALIDS.

The peduncle of the first pair of uropoda (p. 38, fig. 71) 18 about
three times as long as broad, with feebly convex and serrated margins3
it is longer than the last coalesced 11131 seglnent, and nearly twice as
long as the outer ramus, which is more than a third longer than the
inner3 the rami are lanceolate, and serrat-ed on both margins The
second pair reach fully as far as the first; the peduncle is longer
than the last &oalesced 11131 segment, and more than three times as long 0
as broad, with the margins serrated; the outer ramus is 111018 than half
as long as the peduncle, and a little longer than the inner3 the rami
318 ’1131103181 111311 111 1118 first pair, and are serrat-ed on both margins
The third pair are not twice as long 38 1118 1818011; 1118 peduncle is 801118-
what broader than long, and a third part as long as the outer ramus,
which is a little longer than the inner3 the rami are serrated as in the
preceding pair.

The tel-son is broadly tongue-shaped, with the margins serrated,
and is twice 38 long as the peduncle of the last pair of uropoda.

COLOUR. Yellowish white
LENGTH. The male 17 111111, the female 9 111111.
HAB. The tropieal region of the Atlantic.

2. Glossoeephalus spiniger‚ C. Bommms, 1887.
Pl. V, fig. 6——9; and p. 26, fig. 265 p. 29, fig. 43.

Diagsn. The head is longer than the first three peraeonalsegments
together; the rostrum is not a third part as long as the
rest of the head.

The inetacarpus of the first pair of perceopoda has the hind
margin armed with a very long, sharp tooth at the middle,
and some small teeth above it, and the lower front corner
produced into 3. long, sharp-pointed tooth, which is about
half as long as the dactylus The third pair are about as
long as the fourth, and much shorter than the fifth. The
carpus of the fifth pair 18 1101 twice as long as 1118 tibia.
The sixth pair are fully as long 38 1118 fifth. The seventh
pair are much shorter than the femur of the sixth, scarcely
reaching to three-fourths of its length.

The lateral parts of the pleonal segments are angular behind.
