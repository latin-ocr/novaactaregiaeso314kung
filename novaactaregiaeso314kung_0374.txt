96 CAm, BovALLms, THE Oxrcarfflmns.

The telson is more than two and a half times as long as it
is broad at the base3 and is considerably longer than the
last pair of uropoda; the apex is broadly rounded.

The helmet-shaped head (Pl. IV, fig. 7> viewed in profile resembles
that figured by STREETS (26, pl. 2, fig. 36) from the female of Srebbinyella
ssim-otim. It is very broad and deep, almost as deep as it is long
without the rostrum. The under side of the rostrum is bordered behind
by a small dnplioature of the integument.

The first pair of ‹mteomoe (Pl. lV, fig. 8) have the first joint of
the flagellum twice as long as it is broad at the apex3 the three following
joints are subequal in length, and are together quite as long as the under'
margin of the first joint.

The perceon has the segments very neatly defined but not pro-
truding. The epimerals are entirely smooth and even, without tuberoles
or spinous processes, and are somexvhat longer than the under margins
of the correspondiug peraeonal segments.

The first pair of peroeopocla (p. 32, fig. 53) have the carpus
nearly as long as broad3 the metaoarpus is as long as the carpus, with
the front margin convex3 the dactylus is gently curved‚ half as long
as the metacarpus, and smooth on the hind margin. The second pair
(Pl. IV, fig. 9) are only a little longer than the first3 the metacarpus
is a little longer than the carpus, the dactylus is half as long as the
inetaoarpus, and is like that in the first pair. The third and fourth
pairs are very slender and equal in length. The fifth pair are longer
than the sixth2 the femur is broad, only a fourth part longer than broad,
and a little longer than the three following joints together. The femur
of the sixth pair is broadly pear-shaped, about a fifth part longer
than broad, and about a sixth part broader than that of the fifth pair. The
seventh p air have an almost trapeziform femur, which is as broad at the
base as it is long, and a little longer than all the following joint-s together.

The pleon is somewhat longer than the last five peraeonal seg-
ments together. The under margins of the segments are straight.

The last coaleseed aral segment is less than a third part longer
than it is broad at the base.

The first pair of uropmla (p. 38, fig. 72) reaoh a little beyond
the middle of the inner ramus of the last pair, the pedunole is
longer than the last coaleseed ural segnient, almost linear, and about
four times as long as broad, with the lower parts of the margins
