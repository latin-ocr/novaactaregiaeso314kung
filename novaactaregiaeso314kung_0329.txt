SlMORHYNCHOTUS S‘rssssssmm. 51

The sennn· of the first and second pairs of peraaeopoda is
much longer than all the following joints together. The
feninr of the seventh pair is about as long 38 three-fourths of
that of the sixth, and is 38 broad as the femur of the fifth pair.

The peduncle of the first pair of uropoda is shorter than the
inner ramus, but a little longer than the outer. The outer
rannus of the second pair is much shorter than the peduncle.
The outer rainns of the last pair is more than half 38 long as
the inner, and styliforni.

The tels-on is as long as broad, and acute at the apex.

As Sz'moesslzysnclzoz·us antemzarz'us, STEBBING, is, in my opinion, speci-
fically distinct fron] S. nummarius, Omns, I have proposed here a new
naine for the former. I have done so without any hesitation because I
have niyself taken and examined specilnens of both, and Ι have thus been
able to complete in respect to some minor details the description given by
Srssssssmo from 3 single and somewhat damaged specimen:

The npper surface of the lzeacl is somewhat deeper than the dorsal
line of the peraeon. Seen from below the under side of the rostral por-
tion is strongly concave, and much narrower than a third of the head.

The lower hind corner of the first flageller joint of the first pair
of antemzoe is produced downwards, but does not reach to the under
margin of the second flagellar joint. The third flagellar joint is much
shorter than the second3 the fourth joint is fully as long as the two
preceding together.

The fifth perceomzl segment is longer than the sixth; the seventh
is as long 38 the sixth.

The metacarpns of the first pair of perceopmla is short-er than the
carpus3 the dactylus is a third part 38 long 38 the metacarpus. The
carpus of the second pair is not twice 38 long as it is broad at the
lower end3 the free part of the under margin is more than half as long
as the hind margin of the metacarpus3 the lower hind corner is angular; the
dactylus is a third part as long as the metacarpus. The fifth pair are
as long as the peraeon and the first two pleonal segments together; the
femur is twice 38 long as broad, much shorter than the three following
joints together, and only a little longer than the metacarpus. The femur of
the sixth pair is a third part longer than broad, irregularly pear-shaped,
