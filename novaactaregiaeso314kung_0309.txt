MORPHOLOGICAL Nowsss. 31

In the Xiphocephalidae on the other hand there exist no ovi-
tectrices, but the eggs on leaving the oviduct are fixed on the under side
of the body, probably by means of some kind of cement, which is pos-
sibly secreted from some of the strongly developed glands in thejoints
of the peraeopoda. In any case the manner of carrying the eggs and
embryos is very remarkable, and, as far as I know, has not been pre-
viously observed (fig. 47). A different number of eggs are fixed under
the different segments: under the first I have never observed a single

egg, under the second three or four pairs are fixed at equal intel-vals,
under each of the third and fourth four or five, under the fifth seven
or eight, under the sixth five or six pairs and none under the seventh,
one female thus carrying in all from forty to fifty eggs or embryos. I
have observed very young eggs thus placed, they being in fact in the
third or fourth stage of division, and quite globular (fig. 48), as well as
embryos just on the point os breaking the egg membrane (fig. 49), the
form of the egg in this case being elongate-ovate, and the young being
provided with six pairs of peraeonal legs, distinctly developed and ar-
med with strong claws.

The first and second pairs of perwoporla are developed into strong
grasping or prehensile organs, and show in the different genera almost
all the modifications of such organs which are to be observed among

the other Hyperids.

We meet with the less complioated forn] in the first pair of pe-
raeopoda of Simorhynchotus (fig. 50), that is to say:

1. The folding hand (fig. 50), in which the carpus is only a little di-
lated, and has a more 01· less rounded hind margin, so
that the metacarpus can be doubled up along it so as
to impinge against its lziml margin, the dactylus thus
coming in (tontact with the tibia.
