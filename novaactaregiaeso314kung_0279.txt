THE OXYCEPHALIDS.

The Oxyc eph alids are perhaps the most interesting of all the Am-
phipoda Hyperiidea on account of their strange externa] forms as well
as the curious transformations which several of their internal and extern-
al organs are subjected to. However‚ it is not only because they pre-
sent such remarkable features as these that I have been induced to take
them up now. The many intricate questions connected with the syno-
nymy of the genera and species have to-day acquired an immediate inter-
est through the publication of two great works both of the highest im-
portance for our knowledge of the Amphipods, »Die Platysceliden»
by C. CLAus in 1887, and »Report on the Amphipoda collected
by H. M. S. Challenger during the years 1873-1876»7 by the Rev.
THOMAs R. R. STEBBING in 1888. As my own opinions with regard to the
synonymy and relationship os many of the Oxycephalidean species, briefly
stated in a preliminary paper »Systematical list of the Amphipoda
Hyperiidea», differ on several points from those of the eminent carci-
nologists just mentioned, Ι have felt in duty bound to state more fully
the reasons on which my systematical arrangement of this abnormal
group of animals is founded. Resides, I wish to make use of this op-
portunity for communicating some new results arrived at by the exami-
nation of fresh material recently obtained.

As an introduction I am going to give some historical and mor-

phological notes on the Hyperide in question.
