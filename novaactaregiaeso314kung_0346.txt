the tibia has a row of spines along the front margin, two very short
spines and 0110 long one alternating3 the front margin of the carpus is
armed in the same way, with three short ones and one long one alternating;
the serration of the front margin of the metacarpus is more irregular; the
dactylus is serrated. The seventh pair 103011 beyond the apex of the
carpus of the sixth pair; the femur is narrow, elongated, and as long as
the femur of the sixth pair3 the front margin is concave3 the metacarpus
is somewhat longer 111311 1110 three preceding joints together.

The pleon is about as long as the last six peraeonal segments
together.

The last coalesced 'zarai seginent 18 nearly twice as long as broad.

The first pair of mopodrz (Pl. ΙΙ, fig. 12) reach to the apex of
the last pair, and beyond the apex of the telson; the peduncle is a little
longer 111311 1110 1111101 13111118, which 18 considerably longer than the outer;
both are serrated. The second pair reach beyond the apex of the
peduncle of 1110 1381 pair; the peduncle is longer 111311 1110 1111101 13111118,
which is longer and broader 111311 1110 011101; both are serrated. The
third pair are considerably longer 111311 1110 telson; the peduncle is
shorter than the 131111, which are equal in length, and serrated.

The telsow 18 about a third part longer than broad, triangular,
