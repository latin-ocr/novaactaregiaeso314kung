OXYCEPHALUS PsscrmA’rus. 65

long as it is broad at the apex, the three following joints together are
a little longer than the breadth of the first flagellar joint. The second
pair (p. 27, fig. 29) 616 longer and more robust than in O-vycepltalus
piseagor, or in O. Clam.

The perseam, is entirely smooth, and the epimerals are less deep
than in O. pis-eaeor, scarcely equalling a fourth part of the height of the
peraeon.

The first pair of perceapaenla (Pl. ΙΙ, fig. 5) are shorter than the
second3 the front margin of the carpus runs in a line with that of the
metacarpus3 the carpal process is about as long as the stem of the
joint, and is armed along its front margin with closely 361, long‚spine-
like 166111, which give a combe-like appearance to the whole3 the apex of
the process foroms a strong, sharp 100111. Τ116 metacarpus is stout, and
somewhat longer than 1116 stem of the carpus3 its hind margin does
not form an eclge as in Omyeeplaams piscatom it is as long7 and armed
in the same way⁷ as the front margin of the carpal process, but the
spine-like teeth are a little shorter. The dactylus is about a third part
as long as the metacarpus7 and 1163 6 100111 61 1116 middle of the hind
·margin. The second pair (Pl. ΙΙ, fig. 6> have the cheliform hand
comparatively much shorter than in Oszgzsceplzalus piscator or in Ο. lochos-tris,
the carpus, without the process, being scarcely longer than the meta-
carpus; the front margin runs in a line with the front margin of the
metacarpus3 the 6611161 process is longer than the rest of 1116 joint3 its
front side is armed as in the first pair, but the teeth composing the
pectination are much longer; the hind margin of 1116 metacarpns, which
is considerably shorter than the carp-al process, has exactly the same
pectination, and is bordered by four or five long bristles. The dactylus
is like that in the first pair. The fifth pair are the longest; the femur
is elongate, having the front margin straight and the hind convex3 it
is more than twice 63 long 63 broad, and shorter than 1116 three following
joints together. The femur of the sixth pair 13 6 third part longe} 111611
broad, and much shorter than the four following ](11113 together, and has
the margins smooth; the front margins of the tibia and carpus are armed
as in Ooeyceplzalus piscator‚· the front margin of the metacarpus has a
similar armature, but with a varying number of short spines between
the single long spines3 the dactylus is strongly pectinated. The seventh
pair reach scarcely to the apex of the tibia of the sixth pair3 the upper
hind portion of the femur is considerably dilated and forms an obtuse angle3

the metacarpus is as long as the carpus, and 6 trifie shorter than the tibia.
