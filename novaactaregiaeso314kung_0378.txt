Dia-sm. The segments of the body are bulging and protruding‚ but
not earinated. The fifth epimeral has a prominent, curved
spine, directed baekvvards.

The head is a little longer than the first five peraeonal seg-
ments together. The rostrum is narrow and eham-pointed,
and is half as long as the rest of the head.

The first four joints of the second pair of antennae are un-
equal in length and strongly arohed.

The first pair of peroeopofla have the under margin of the
carpus smooth, with the hind corner projeoting into a spine-
like tooth3 the hind margin of the metaoarpus is about as
long as the under margin of the carpus. The second pair
have the carpus like that in the first pair; the hind margin
of the metaoarpus is shorter than the under margin of the
carpus. On the femur os the fifth and sixth pairs there are
no pits, but'along the middle of the femur of the seventh
pair there is a long ridge and two pits. The seventh pair
are much longer than the femur of the sixth, and reaeh
almost to the apex of the tibia of that pair.

The pleon is a little longer than the last four peraeonal segments
together; the under margin of the pleonal segments is al-
most. straight; the hind corner is produced and sharp-pointed.

The last coaleseed ural segment is more than twice as long
as the telson.

The first pair of uropoda reach to the apex of the telson.
