the peraeon between the peraeopoda, as in the immediately preceding
families of the Amplzipoda eurvieorm'a, but the anterior part of the folded
antennae, conoealed under the head, is comparatively longer than in those
families. This feature is very interesting as showing the close relation
between the Oxyeephalidae and the Lycoez’doe. In the other genera the
first joint is only a little shorter than the second, and the second pair
of antennae are, when folded, concealed for their whole length under
the head within the above mentioned hollow ohannel, and within the
lower part of the spaeious chamber, in which the first pair of antennae

· are fixed. The length of the antennae in these latter genera depende naturally
