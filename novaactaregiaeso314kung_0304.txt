which is very stout, while the third is distinct; the first joint of the fia-
gellum is not curved, but in a straight line with the peduncle, and much
longer than it, though not thicker. In the family Oxycephalidae,
the first flagellar joint is followed by a second and third, the last longer

and more slender than the second. In the family Xiphocephalidae
the flagellum consists of only one joint, much longer than the peduncle‚
bulbous or tumid at the lower end, and carrying some long olfactory hairs.

6. The second pair of antennae.

They consist in the male of five joints in all the genera except
Glossocephalus, where they are composed of six. The first four
joints are elongated, articulating with
each others in such a way as to ¹allow
of being folded up like a carpenter's
rule. The last or the last two joints
in Glossocephalus are minute, and
the articulation allows of but little move-
ment.⁴ The first joint of the second
pair of antennae varies in length, ac-
cording to the length of the head,
being shorter than half the' second
joint in the genera Simorhynchotus,
Tullbergella and Cranocephalus
⁷(fig. 27 and 28). With this shortness
of the first joint is connected a very
important difference in the manner of
hiding the antennae when folded. [n the three just mentioned genera
the folded antennae are. concealed for more than half their length under
