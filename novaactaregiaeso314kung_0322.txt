IV. THE OXYCEPHALIDEAN GENERA AND SPECIES.

As Ι have already said Ι think it convenient to divide the Oxyoe-
phalids into two 1311111166, instituting a new family Xiphocephalidae for
the genus Xiphocephalus. I separate 11116 genus from the other Oxy-
cephalids, because 11 16 distinguished from the other genera by charac-
teristics which in my opinion have a more than generic value. So for
instance Xiphocephalus has the seventh pair of peraeopoda rudimen-
tmy, and consisting of only the femur, while the other genera have the
same pair ooniplete¹); Xiphocephalus normally has the telson free from,
and articulating with, the last ura] segment‚ while 311 1116 011161 genera
have 1116 1616011 fused with the last 11131 segment; and lastly the female
01 Xiphocephalus wants oviteotrices‚ and carries the eggs and young
fixed under the peraeonal segments in two regular rows, while the other
genera have well developed ovitectrioeS. On the other hand the two
1311111166 316 connected by some common 0113130161161106, 36 101 instance

both faniilies, and the 1061131 elongation 01 1116 forepart 01 1116 head,

besides expressed in the form 01 1116 16111013 01 1116 fifth and sixth pairs
of pereeopoda in Xiphocephalidae, but not met with in these parts in
Oxyoephalidae7 not even in the genera Leptocotis and Calamo-
rhynchus, which show much elongated uropods.

DANA was 1116 first (17, p. 1009, see above⁷ p. 5) who took 1116
Oxyoephalids as 3 whole placing them 36 3 subfainily, Oaeycepltalinae‚.
of the family TyplziMe, at the side of the subfamilies Typlcz‘noe and Pro-
720i7zoe3 he then gave the following diagnosis of the Oxycephalinoe:

»Abdomen in ventrem 66 11011 flectens. Caput oblongum, antennis
lmis superficiem capitis inferiorem insitis».

- 1) Except Tullbergella which has the femur and three following joints.
