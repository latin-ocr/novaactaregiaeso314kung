ural segment, and are nearly as long as 1118 third pair. The
outer ramus of the first two pairs is nearly as long as the
inner; the outer ramus of the third pair is not half as long
as the inner.

The telson is about as long as the 1381. pair of uropoda, and
is as long as the urus.

Xiphocephalus Lilljeborgi differs from the other species in
the form of the first pair of peraeopoda and their epimerals‚ in the form ¹and
length of the seventh peraeonal segment, in the length of the first pair
of uropoda‚ and in the relation between the rami of all the three pairs.

The peroeon. The first segment is about two-thirds as long as the
second; the seventh is scarcely a fourth part shorter than the sixth.

The epimeral of the first pair of peraeopoda is deeper than long,
obtusely triangular, with the apex directed straight downwards. That-
of the seventh pair has the hind corner a little projecting downwards,
with the apex obtuse.

The perceopoda. The oarpal process of the first pair (Pl. VII,
fig. 23) is triangular, armed with two low teeth on the hind margin, and
provided with two or three broad teeth on the front margin, which is a
little longer than the hind margin of the metacarpus, but does not attain
the middle of the dactylus3 the hind margin of the metacarpus is pro-
duced at the lower corner into a rounded and serrated process3 the
dactylus 18 strongly curved, and is quite as long as the metacarpus.
The second pair (Pl. VH, fig. 24) are much longer than the first;
the carpal process is very slender and sharp-pointed, reaching far beyond
the apex of the metacarpus, and beyond the middle of the dactylus.
The third and fourth pairs are similar in shape and equal in length;
the tibia is about as long as the femur. The fifth and sixth pairs
are sinilar in shape, but unequal in length, the sixth pair being distinctly
longer than the fifth; the metacarpus is scarcely longer than the carpus.
The single joint of the seventh pair is almost truncated at the apex.

The pleon is not carinated, and is longer than the whole peraeon.
The under margin of the segments 18 convex; the hind corner is feebly
produced and sharp-pointed.
