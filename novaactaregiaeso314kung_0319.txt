71. The nervous system.

The ganglionic chain shows a strongly developed supra-oeso-
phagial‚ or ceph-alic ganglion3 from its anterior corners extend the
very stout and thick optical nerves, dilating apically into an ovate or
bean-shaped disc, Which is more or less closely pressed against the layer
formed by the retina. Between the optical nerves rise two stout nerves
from the front margin of the cephalic ganglion, and run to the first
pair of antennae; at the base of these antennal nerves are situated the
two vesicles which have been interpreted by Omns ¹) as auditory organs.
These vesicles are small in the Oxycephalidae but very largely develop-
ed in the Xiphocephalidae. The cornmissural cor-ds connecting the
cephalic ganglion with the infra-oesophagial ganglion are thick and stout,
much thicker than for instance in Laneeolidoe. Close upon the infra·
oesophagial ganglion follow the first two pairs of peraeonal ganglia; they
are not coalesced with the infra-oesophagial ganglion but in the Oxy-
cephalidae they are so closely pressed against it that the commissural
cords between them are scarcely perceptible. The following four pairs
of peraeonal ganglia are equidistant, situated each in the middle of the
corresponding segments, the third, fourth, fifth, and sixth. The pair of
ganglia supplying the seventh peraeonal segment and its appendages
with nerves are situated just at the limit between the sixth and seventh
segments, close to the preceding pair of ganglia but not coalesced with
it. In the hind portion of the body the ganglionic chain shows three
pairs of ganglia, one pair situated in the middle of each of the pleonal
segments, and the last consisting of two or three pairs, fused together
and 60 supplying the whole urus with nerves. The ganglionic chain is
thus composed of twelve pairs of ganglia, some pairs being placed 010-
sely together. The commissural cords run close to one another, but
are not coalesced. In the Xiphocephalidae the first two pairs of pe-
raeonal ganglia are more separated from one another and from the infra-
oesophagial ganglion, so that the commissural cords are distinct, but
not longer than the ganglia themselves.

12. The glands.

Glands are present in most of the ι1011116 of the peraeopoda and
uropoda of all the species of both the families. They are either simple,
