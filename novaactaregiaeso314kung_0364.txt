pair3 the feebly produced lower corner is set with bristles on the sides,
the apioal tooth is short and broad, but sharp-pointed3 the metacarpus
is more slender than in the first pair, but armed in the same way. The
fifth pair are much longer than the sixth; the femur is more than
twice as long as broad, and considerably longer 11131] the three following
,1011118 together. The sixth pair (Pl. ΙΙΙ, fig. 10) have the femur
irregularly peanshaped, and longer than all the following joints together3
the genu 311161113168 subapically with the femur as in all the species of
Streetsia, whioh I have examined‚ and is fixed on the inner side of
the femur so that the last five joints of the leg are entirely concealed
under the femur when folded up. For this reason the name pronoid es
has been applied to the speeies, but this feature is not confined to this
speeies but common to all the species of Streetsia, as just men-
tioned. The sront margin of the tibia is pectinated With longer and
shorter teeth⁷ one long 0116 and two short ones alternating; the lower
front and hind oorners are produced. The seventh pair (Pl. ΙΙΙ, fig.
11) 316 quite as long as the femur of the sixth3 the femur is ovate,
not fully twice as long as broad, and distinotly longer 111311 all the follow-
ing joints together.

The pleon is somewhat shorter than the first six peraeonal seg-
ments together. The hind corner of the third segment is not produced
but is angular.

The first pair of uropoda (Pl. ΙΙΙ, fig. 12) reaoh about to the
apex of the last pair3 the pedunole 18 1111631, and 18 about five times as long
as broad; the rami are elongate-lanceolate3 the inner 18 serrated 011 both
margins, and 18 only a little longer 111311 1116 011161, Which is serrated on
the inner margin and smooth on the outer. The second pair reaoh a
little beyond the apex of the pedunole of the last pair; the peduncle
18 81101161· than the inner 13111118, which is broader, and oonsiderably longer,
than the outer, both are serrated 38 111 1116 first pair. The third pair
reaoh 38 far as two-thirds of 1116 length of 1116 1618011, 1116 pedunole is
oonsiderably shorter than the inner ramus, and quite 38 long 38 1116 011161,
which 18 11111611 narrower than the inner ramus; both are serrated as in
the first pair.

The telson has the margins 811100111, and only feebly curved.
