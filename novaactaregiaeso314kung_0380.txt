segment being sculptured on the sides and showing large
grooves. The body increases in breadth from the first peraeon-
al segment to the middle of the fifth, then narrovvs abruptly
towards the pleon; the fifth epimeral thus shows an angular
protruding tubercle.

The head is longer than the first six peraeonal segments
together; the rostrum is not fully as long as the rest of
the head, and is triangular, and sharp-pointed.

The first four joints of the second pair of antennae are subequal
in length, and are feebly bent.

The first pair of peroeopocla have the under margin of the
carpus serrated, with the hind corner feebly projecffing, and
sharp-pointed; the hind margin of the carpus is also serrated;
the hind margin of the metacarpus is serrated, without
spines, and is shorter than the under margin of the carpus.
The second pair have the under margin of the carpus
serrated, and the hind corner does not project more than in
the first pair3 the hind margin is notehed, and provided
with four or five spinelike bristles3 the hind margin of the
met-acarpus is serrated, and is nearly as long as the under
margin of the carpus. Along the middle of the femur of
the fifth pair there are three pits, on that of the sixth four,
and on that of the seventh pair three pits and some larger
grooves at the apex of the joint. The seventh pair are
much longer than the femur of the sixth, and reach beyond
the apex of the tibia.

The pleon is a little longer than the last four peraeonal seg-
ments together3 the under margin of the pleonal segments
is feebly convex3 the hind corner is squared, and not at
all produced.

The last coalesced aral segment is a third part longer than
the telson. ·

The first pair of uropocla reach to the apex of the last pair.
The rami are narrowly elongate.

The telson is almost lauceolate, and reaches scarcely beyond
the apex of the last pair of uropoda.

Stebbingella Theeli is very similar to S. sclerotica in form,
and if there were not the differences in the armature of the first two
