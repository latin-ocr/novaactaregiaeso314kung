STEBmNGELLA ΤΗΕΕΜ. 103

pairs of peraeopoda, in the length of the seventh pair and of the last
coalesced ural segment, they would rather be looked upon as local varie-
ties. As far as it is possible to judge from the description of STREETS,
and from his unsatisfactory drawing, there are great differences in the
sculpture on the pei-zeon and pleon.

The species is one of the most beautiful of all the Hyperids, and
it. is a wonder that it has so long escaped the attention of zoologistsr

The integument of the body (Pl. V, fig. 13 p. 21 fig. 3) is very
thick and calcareous, showing a rich sculpture, especially on the peraeon,
which consists of protruding bands or rolls, straight and curved, and
curiously formed nobs and tubercles, interrupted by notches and furrows.
The epimerals are very thick, the third, fourth, and fifth are much thicker
than high; the fifth is abruptly incised or rather truncates] at the middle
so as to form a broadly protruding angular tubercle, which, however,
does not project into a more or less curved spine-like tooth as in the
two other species.

The head is dorsally carinated, and is considerably longer in the
female than in the male, especially as to the rostrum. In the male
(p. 21, fig. 3) the rostrum is half as long again as it is broad at
the base (i. e. the point of fixation of the first pair of antennae), and a
little shorter than the rest of the head3 in the female, on the other
hand, the rostrum is more than three times as long as it is broad at
the base, and longer than the rest of the head; the rostrum is closed
on the under side more completely in the female than in the male.

The first pair of αηιῬηνια)Υ in the male have the first flagellar
joint twice as long as it is broad at the under margin; the projecting
lower front corner is a little more than a third part as longas the under
margin of the joint3 the second joint is a little shorter than the third,
which is a trifle shorter than the fourth3 all the three together are
shorter than the under margin of the first flagellar joint. The first
peduncular joint in the female is very long3 the flagellum is slender
and consiste of three joints. The second pair in the male reach to
the middle of the rostrum3 the first joint is tolerably curved, and a little
shorter than the second, which is shorter than the third; the fourth is
much shorter than the second.

The first pair of pei-ceopoala (Pl. V, fig. 2) are considerably
smaller than the second3 the carpus is a third part broader than long,
and has the lower front corner a little protruding in front of the base of
