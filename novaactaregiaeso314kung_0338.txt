Diayn. The body is soinewhat compressed, the segments of the peraeon
are seutellated, separated from each others by deep furrows.
The head is shorter than the. peraeon, with a moderately long
rostrum, which in the male is abruptly narrowed near the apex,
but in the female tapers evenly, and has the apex rounded.
The hind part of the. head is a littlelonger than the rostrum.
The front margin of the carpel process of the first two pairs
of perceiopoda is longer than the hind margin of the nieta-
carpus, which is serrated and bordered with strong bristles;
the lower front corner of the carpus protrudes a little
in the first pair and much in the second, forming a broad
heel in front of the metae-arpos. The fifth pair are much
longer than the sixth. The femur os the sixth pair is almost
circular, much broader than that. of the fifth, and about as
long as that of the seventh pair, which is itself longer
than all the following joints together.

The lateral parts of the pleonal segments are rounded in
front3 at the middle of the under margin of each projectsa
strong, tooth-like process7 and the hind corner is produced
and sharp-pointed.

The last coalesced ural segment is only a little longer than
the telson.

The telson reaches beyond the apex of the last pair of uropoda.
