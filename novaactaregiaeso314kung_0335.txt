OXYCEPHALUs PlsGATOR. 57

The latera] parts of the pleon! segments are founded in front
and below, and the under margins are not produced into
tooth-like projectionffi the hind corners are angulated, and
sharp-pointed, but not produced.

The last coalesced mul seg-nient is much longer than the telson,
but not twice as long.

The peduncle of the first and second pairs of uropocla is
longer than the inner ramus3 the peduncle of the third pair
is a little shorter than the inner ramus. The outer rami
are somewhat shorter than the inner.

The tel-son is tongue-shaped, with the apex sharp-pointed and
the margins serrated; it is somewhat shorter than the last
pair of uropoda.

The animal⁷ described and figured below is, in my opinion, the
true Oxycephalus piscator of H. MILNE EDWARDs; a comparison of
the original diagnosis with the following description and drawings will
show that all the characteristics given by H. MILNE EDWARDs agree with
those of this animal. I ain also pretty sure that the Oxyceplealus similis,
OLAUS‚ is identical with this species, the more so as I have examined
many specimens taken at the very same locality⁷ Messina, by my friends
Professor HJALMAR Tfn'zm. and Dzr A. APPELOF. And again I an] con-
vinced that Ooeyceplzalus Edwarclsii, G. W. THOMsoN, is nothing but the

young male of O. piscator. Whether O. bulbosus, ΤΗ. ΞΤΒΕΕΤΒ, is an
