present treatise as belonging to the genus Streetsia⁷ STE13131NG3 011966-
phalas typhoides, Omns, and Ο. ειτίενοῐὶσιιδ, Srsnnrs, both here transferred
to the genus Stebbingella‚ n. g.; Leptocotz's Lindstrbmi,11. sp.‚ here
named Dorycephalus Lindstromi3 Leptocotistenuirostris, C1,Aus;
Tullbergella⁷ n. g, with the new species Τ. cuspidata3 Calamorhyn-
chus pellucidus, STREETs3 Rlzabdon&ateis7 n. n. instead of Rhabdwoma,
which name the writer supposed to be preoccupied, but wrongly, as
STEBBING (l. c. p. 1606) has clearly proved. Diagnoses were also given
of Rlz. ammaum, H. MILNE EDwARns, and Rlz. Whitez', SPENCE ΒΑΤΕ.

111 1887 the important work of Omns, 36, »Die Platysceliden» was
issued. He gave there good drawings of all the species described in
his previous paper of 1879 (see p. 8). He maintained his opinions
about Oaeyceplzalus piscator, H. MILNE EDwARns7 and Rlaabdowma armatum,
H. Mum: EDWARDS, spoken of above (p. 7 and 8). The descriptive partis a
reprint of his paper of 1879, with some few additions.

ln the same year G. M. Gaas, 37, described a new species of Rhab-
dosoma, Rlz. investiglatoris, which is however undoubtedly synonymous with
Xiphoceph alus Whitei⁷ SPENCE ssmffi GlLEs expressed the opinion that
CLAUS was quite right in considering Rlzabclosoma mirei, SPENCE ΒΑΤΕ,
as the male of Rlz. armatum, H. MILNE EDWARns.

In December 1887 Ι gave, 38, a diagram of the systematical rela—
tions of the Hyperiidean families, in which the Oxycephalidae are recorded

as the thirteenth family and placed between the Tryplzcenicloe and the
Pt‘mzoicloe.
