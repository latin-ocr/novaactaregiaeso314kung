however four 01· four and a half times as long as broad; that of the
sixth pair (ΡΙ. VI, fig. 10> is more dilated, being about three and a
half times as long as broad3 the tibia and carpus are narrow and linear
in the male and in the not ovigerous female, but much infiated in the
female which carries eggs, The seventh pair consist of a single
bladder-like joint, which is broader below.

The pleon is about as long fis the pemeon, andis dol-sally carinat—
ed. The under margin of the segments is feebly curved⁷ the hind
corner is eham-pointed, but scarcely produced.

The urus is about as long as the last two pleonal seglnents
together; the first ural segnient is wicker, and considerably shorter‚
than the last ooalesced seginent. On the under side of the segments
run two marginal, serrat-ed ridges.

The first pair of mopocla (Pl. VI, fig. 11) in the adult male and
female are considerably shorter than the last pair, and do not reach to
the middle of that pair3 they are more than twice as long as the second
pair, and have the inner ramus about. half as long as the outer. The
second pair (ΡΙ. VI, fig. 12) do not reach beyond the apex of the
last coalesced ural segment‚ and have the outer ramus a fourth part as
long as the inner, which is about a sixth part as long as the peduncle.
The third pair (Pl. VI, fig. 13, and p. 80, fig. 40) are much shorter
than the telson, and have the outer ramus very diminutive being shorter
than a twelfth part of the inner.

The telson is straight⁷ sharp-pointed, and has serrated margins3
it is much longer than the pleon and urus together.
