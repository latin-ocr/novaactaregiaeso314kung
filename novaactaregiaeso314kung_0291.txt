SYSTEMATICAL NOTEs. 13

The first is essentially the same as MiLNE EDWARDs⁷ fourth char-
acteristic but is more vaguely expressed. The second has, in my opi-
nion, no value, because almost all the Hyperids I have studied have thc
power of doubling up the urus under the body⁷ though this power is
not equally developed in the different genera. The third characteristic is
utterly artificial, and the use of it would lead to the separation of closely
related genera, and would place them in different families as for instance
Euthemz‘sto among the Plzronimc'dce instead of close to Hyperia.

SPENCE ΒΑΤΕ in 1862 followed DANA as to the distinction of Hy-
peridoe and Phronimidoe from the other Hyperids, but for the division of
these latter into three families Platyscelicloe‚ Plzorcidoe and Ooegsceplzaliclae,
he used the following characteristics.

1. The head munded, -— or long, anteriorly produced.
2. The eyes occupying the whole head —- or only a part of it.

3. The fifth pair of peraeopoda with the femur largely developed, —-
or imperfectly developed.
The first and second characteristics are not valuable for distinguish-
ing subtr-ibes and scarcely constant as family-characteristics‚ while the
third is a purely generic characteristic.

O. Omns in 1879 included under the name »Platgssceliclem the fol-
lowing five families 1. Typhidce, 2. Seeliclce, 3. Pronoz'dce, 4. Lycaeidoe,
and 5. Ooecyeplzalz'dce, and used the following family-characteristics.

1. The body broad and short, — or inore or less compressed‚ elongated.
2. The urus able to be doubled up, — or without this power.

3. The femora of the fifth and sixth pairs of peraeopoda largely de-

veloped, forming covers for the underside of body, — or the
femora elongated and nan-owed.

4. The urus very short, - or elongated.

5. The mouth-organs broad and short, — or elongated and narrow.
The first characteristic Ι have already said is too vague and, in

my opinion, only of a specific value, for if you compare for instance the
female of Hyperia Latrez'llei with the female of Eutyplzis ovoz‘des, we find
the breadth of the body to be almost the same, and the body often not
more depressed in Ezctgspln's than in Hyperia. Also among the Lycaeiclcc
there are species almost fully as broad as a Ditlzgsrus or an Amphithyrus.
The second is, as I have already observed when discussing the family-
