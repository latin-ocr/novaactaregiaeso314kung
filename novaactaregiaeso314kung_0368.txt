90 CARL Bovmmms, THE OXYCEPHALms.

The telson is lanceolate, very sharp-pointed‚ and somewhat
more than twice as longm as broad.

Syn· 1887. Oxycephalus Steenstrupi‚ C. BOVALLIUS. 35, p. 37.

Streetsia Steenstrupi comes near to the next species, S. lonqi-
66138, Omns, but differs from it in the very long¹ and strongly developed
seventh pair of peraeopoda, by the last coalesced ural segment being
rather shorter than the telson, and by the peduncle of the second
and third pairs being not longer than the corresponding inner rami.

The Ooeyceplzalzcs longyiceps, STEBBING, agrees with the specimens
of Streetsia Steenstrupi‚ which Ι have examined, in the characte-
ristics of the seventh pair of peraeopoda and the uropoda‚ and thus decid-
edly differs from Oazyeephalus longsicep& Omns, but as it also differs from
Streetsia Steenstrupi in the characteristics of the first two pairs of
pereeopoda, I can scarcely consider it identical either with the present
species or with Streetsz'a lonyz‘ceps, Omns, and think that it ought to
have a new specific name.

The body is compressed, but not at all carinated.

The hind part of the head is a little constricted3 the rostrum seen
from above is broadly lanceolam, With the apex narrowed.

The first pair of antennae (Pl. III, fig. 3> have the first flagellar
joint fully twice as long as is it is broad at the apex, which is dilated
downwards and forwards; the second flagellar joint is about as long as
the third, and is provided with three very long olfactory hairs3 the fourth
joint is unusually short, cylindricah and scarcely a third part as long as
the third (p. 25, fig. 20).

The epivzerals are high, but not longer than the under margins
of the corresponding peraeonal segments.

The first pair of perceopocla (p. 32, fig. 52) have the carpus con-
siderably longer than broad3 the hind margin is richly fringed with long
stout bristles3 the under margin is contrave, entirely smooth and sharp-
edged; the lower corner is a little projecting forming a broad and short
triangular process, but not outdrawn into a spine-like tooth; the sides
of the triangular projection are densely covered with very stout and
long bristles3 the metaoarpus is very thick and short, less than a third
part longer than broad; the front margin is strongly convex, and provided
with four or five very long bristles3 the hind margin forms a very thin
and sharp edge, which is smooth⁷ but which, when examined under a strong
