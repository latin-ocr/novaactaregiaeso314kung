and Sti-eetsia‚ or at a considerable distance therefrom as in Xipho-
ce‘phalus‚ is occupied by the eyes. The under side of the head is
excavated, forming a groove or charmel from the base of the head to the
anterior end of the eyes, where the channel is enlarged into a vaulted
chamber, at the Upper anterior wall of which the first pair of antennae
are fixed. In this channel the second pair of antennae arc received
when folded, extending into the lower part of> the chamber below the

first pair. Immediately in front of the bases of the first pair of antennae
the rostrum commences, its underside being open in Oxycephalus‚
Sti-eetsia‚ Glossoc‘ephaIUS, Cranocephalus, TullbergeHa, and
Calamorhynchus, and more or less closed in Stebbingella‚ Dory—
cephalus, Leptocotis‚ and Xiphocephalus. The under margins of
the rostral walls are often sharply serrated.

4. The eyes.

As in most of the Hyperiidean families they eyes are also strongly
developed in the Oxycephalids‚ and consist of a great number of ocelli.
These ocelli are not separated into an Upper-eye, (Scheitel-Auge, Olaus),
and two lateral portions on each side as in Thyropus and other genera,
but in all the genera of the family Oxycephalidae‚ with the exception of
Streetsia and Calamorhynchus‚ the ocelli are distribut-ed into two
lateral portioris separated from one another at the crown of the head
by a more or less narrow space. In Streetsia and Oalamorhynchus
on the other hand all the the ocelli are fused together into one mass,
occupying the whole of the central part of the head. The ocelli consist
