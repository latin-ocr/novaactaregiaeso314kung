CALAMORHYNCHUS. 73

in his Report on the »Challengem Amphipoda. The two species are
distinguished from one another by the length of the seventh pair of
peraeopoda, and by that of the uropoda.

A. The seventh pair of peraeopoda are scarcely longer
than the femur of the sixth. l. O. pellucidus.

Β. The seventh pair of peraeopoda are nearly as long as
the whole sixtli pair. 2. C. rigidus.

Diayn. The head is much longer than the whole peraeon3 the rostrum
is shorter than the ocular region of the head.

The second pair of peroeopoda are nearly cheliform, with the
front margin of the carpal process as long as the hind
margin of the metacarpus. The femur of the last three
pairs is lanceolate3 the seventh pair are scarcely longer
than the femur of the sixth pair.

The first pair of uropoda reach to the apex of the second,
but de not attain the apex of the last pair, which are a
little shorter than the telson.

From the original description of Swmms I add the following
details:

»Head long⁷ nearly one-third of the total length, its breadth twice
that of the thorax; neck short, and slightly narrower than the thorax;
the portion containing the eyes oblong, convex above and below when
viewed in profile, elevated above, in the median line, into a sharp ridge,
which terminates at the apex of the rostrum, below the eyes form two
long and rounded lobes separated by a broad, shallow groove; rostrum
flattened, posteriorly broader than the eyes⁷ coinmencing an either side
of the eyes in a broad, rounded wing-like expansion‚ and tapering forward
to a long and acute apex. — — — Segments of the thorax subequal.

-— — — The anterior three abdominal segments subequal⁷ the postero—
