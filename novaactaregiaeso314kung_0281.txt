new species Oaeyceplaalus οσεαηὶσιιε, which he himself later. 8, declared to
be synonyinous with the typica] species of H. MiLNEEDWARDs. In 1839,
6, he gave a new drawing of it.

In 1838 H. MILNE EDWARDs, 5, quoted the two speeies Ooeyceplzalus
»piscatorium and O. oeea7zz'cus; and in 1840, 7, he gave a drawing and a
fuller description of the type speeies, changing the name into Oxy cop h a·
lus piscat0r3 at the same time he gave a diagnosis of a new species.
O. armatus, which is the first representative for the genus Rlzabclosoma
or Xiphooephalus

In the same year⁷ or in 1841, Evnonx and SOULEYET7 8, gave a
long description of Oavycephalus armatus, H. M1LNE EDWARDS.'acooin-
panied by excellent drawings3 it is, however, not the true O. armatus, but
identical with Rhabdosoma eritez', established in 1862 by SPENCE ΒΑΤΕ,
as will be proved below under this species, After the description of the
animal they say l. c. p. 271 that F. E. GussmN, who had aided then] with
the examin-anon, regarded the speeies generioally distinet from Θωμ-
cephalus, and established the genus Xyphocepkalus forits reception. Thus
Xyplzoeeplzalus or Xiphocep halus is the oldest name for the genus and
must be accepted instead of the later names.

In 1848 ARTHUR ADAMS and ADAM WmTE, 9, instituted the genus
Rhabdosoma for the same Ooeyceplzalus armatus, not knowing the just men-
tioned work3 they gave a short generic diagnosis and said that Rlcabdo-
soma armatum »forms a singularly interesting link between the Amphipoda
and the Laemofflpoda, uniting, as it were, the two». They gave also a tolerably
