Diafsn. The body is compressed, and not tuberculate. The segments
of the perman are smooth, not ‘angulated or tubemulated.
The head is shorter than the peraeon, with a short rostrum
which is abruptly narrowed near to the apex in the male,
but evenly tapering in the female. The hind part of the head
is about twice as long as the rostrum, and is somewhat de-
pressed in the male, but inflated and globular in the female.
The front margin of the oarpal process of the first and second
pairs of peneolwsla is longer than the hind margin of the
metaoarpus, which is serrated, and bordered· with strong
bristles3 the lower front corner of the carpus is a little pro-
truding in the first pair butnot at all in the second. The fifth
pair are much longer than the sixth. The femur ofthe sixth
pair is irregularly pear-shaped, only a little broader than that
of the fifth, and somewhat longer than that of the seveuth
pair which is shorter thau all the following joints together.
