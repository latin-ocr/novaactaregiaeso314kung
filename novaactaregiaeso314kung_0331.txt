ramus of the second pair is longer than thc pcduncle. Tho
outer ramus of the lust pair is fully three-fourths us long us
the inncr.

The telson is longer than broad7 and rounded ut the apex.

This species is remarkable for the glol21ular, not produced head⁷
and is besides easily distinguished from its congeners by the charac-
teristics recorded above with respect to the uropoda and the telson.

The upper surface of the head rises a little above the dorsa] linc
of the peraeon. ,

The lower hind corner of the first flagellur joint. of the first pair
of antemzoe is produced downwards7 and reaches a little beyond the under
margin of the second flugellar joint. The third flagellor joint is longer
than the second; the fourth is still longer⁷ but much shorter than the
two preceding joints together.

The fifth perceonal segment is as long as the sixth; the seventh
is as long as the sixth.

The metacarpus of the first pair of peraeopoda (p. 32‚f1g.
503 Pl. Ifig. 4—7) is as long as the ca1·pus; the dactylus is near-
ly a third as long as the metacarpus. The carpus of the sec-
ond pair is a third longer than it is broad at the lower end;
the free part of the under margin is more than half as long as
the hind margin os the. metaourpus3 the lower hind corner is ‹›b-
tusely rounded; the dactylus is about a third as long us the meta-
earpus. The fifth pair are as long as the peraeon and the first pleonal
seg-ments together3 the femur is about twice as long us broad7 much
shorter than the three following joints together, and almost us long as
the metacarpus. The femur of the sixth pair is scarcely longer than
broad, is almost circulor⁷ and much shorter than the three f‹›llowingjoints
together; the carpus is longer than two-thirds of the tibia, and more
than half as long as the metacurpus. The se venth pair reach beyond
the middle of the tibia of the sixth pair.

The first two pleonal segments together are shorter than the last
four peraeonal segments together. The lateral parts of all the segments
are slightly rounded below, and that of the last is angular behind.

The first segment of the urus is somewhat longer than the last
coalesced, which is about as long as the telson.
