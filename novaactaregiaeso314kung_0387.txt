GLossocEPHALus spimossn. 109

The first and second pairs of uropoda reach beyond the apex
of the last pair.

Syn. 1887. Glossocephalus spiniger, C. BOVALLIUS. 35, p. 35.

The first pair of pemeopocla (Pl. V, fig 8) have the same form
as in the preceding species, but the carpal process is longer, armed
with a single, very long, spine-like 100111 011 1110 outer margin, and has
the apex produced into a long, curved, spine-like tooth3 the metacarpus
is much longer than the stem of the carpus, with the hind margin 38
long as the front side of the carpal process3 the spine-like tooth on
1110 hind margin is nearly half as long 3-8 1110 hind margin3 the front
margin is conveX, with the long apic-al tooth nearly straight and sharp-
pointed3 the dactylus is curved, smooth 011 the hind margin, and is
two-thirds as long as the metacarpus. The second pair (Pl. V⁷ fig.
9) have the carpus similar to that in the first pair; the metacarpus is
much longer than the stem of the carpus, with the hind margin concave,
and entirely smooth; the front margin is convex, with the apex project-
ing into a feebly curved tooth, Which is somewhat shorter than that
in the first pair; the dactylus is nearly half as long as 1110 metacarpus
with the hind margin smooth. The third and fourth pairs are equal
in length, more robust than in 1110 preceding speeies, and much shorter
than 1110 fifth pair; the third pair are scarcely four times as long as
the second. The femur of the fifth pair is narrower 111311 111 Glosso-
‹replzalus Milne-Edwardsz'‚ being more than four times 38 long as broad:
the tibia is twice 38 long as broad; the carpus 18 3 third part longer
than the tibia, and about three times as long 38 it is broad at the apex;
1110 metacarpus is dilated, lanceolate, and somewhat shorter than the
carpus. The sixth pair are a trifle longer than the fifth3 the 111013-
carpus is shorter than the two preceding joints together. The femur
of the seventh pair is not half as long as that of the sixth, and is
much longer than all the following joints together.

The oviteetrz'ces are crescent-shaped (Pl. V, fig. 6).

The pleon is much shorter than the last three peraeonal segments
together, and is dorsally feebly carinated.

The last coalesced mal segment is a fourth longer than broad.

The first pair of uropoda reach far beyond the apex of the last
pair; the peduncle is a third part longer than the outer ramus, which is
nearly twice 38 long as 1110 1111101; the peduncle is much longer than the
