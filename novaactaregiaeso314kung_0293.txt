SYSTEMATICAL NOTEs. 15

These three subtribes correspond exactly with the three subdivi-
sions Α, Β, and G in the synoptical diagram given in my »Contributions
to a Monograph of the Amphipoda Hyperiidea», (p. 3> issued in 1887. The
first two subtribes have not the same limits as the first two subclivisions
proposed by MILNE EDWARDs and DANA, but the third has almost the same
liinitation as the »Hyperincs anormales» of Mam: EDWARDs, the family
Typliiclse of ΒΑΝΑ, or the families Flatyseetidce, Flam-cide& and Ooegyeephalislce
together, of SPENCE ΒΑΤΕ, and lastly the same limitation as the »Platy-
scelz’den» of Omns.

B· characteristics for the distinction of the chmtcies in the
subu-ibe HYPERIIDEA CURVIOORNIA.

lee second pair of perceopocla transformed, — 07¹ not transformecl.

The first characteristic distinguishes the Parascelidae and Eulzyplzidce
from the remaining families. The second distinguishes the Plzoreoraplzz'doe,
the Lycoeidoe‚ and the anseeplzalielce from the Pronoiche, Eutyplziclse‚ and Xi-
phoeeplzalz'dce, this last family being instituted here by me for the recep-
tion of the genus Xiphocephalus. The third characteristic separates
the families Plzoreoraplzidce, Pronoz'cloe, Eutlzamneicloe, and Xz'plzoeeplzalz'clce
from the families Lyeoeielce, Ooeyeeplzalidce‚ Parascelz'doe, and Ezctypliidce.
The fourth characteristic distinguishes the Lyecez'dceD from the 00900-
phalidoe and the Xiplzoeeplmliclce, and the Parascelz'cloe from the Eutyplzz'cloe.
The fifth distinguishes the Phoreoraplzidce from all the other families.

Within the subtribe I place the family Plzoreorlzaplzicloe first because
it comes nearest to the Hyperiidea filicornia owing to the situa-
tion of the first pair of antennae3 last in the whole tribe Ι place the
family Eutyphidoe, because it seems to show the most affinity of any of the
Hyperiidean families with the Isopods, especially with the Sphaeromids,
owing to the form of the body and the very intimate coalition between
