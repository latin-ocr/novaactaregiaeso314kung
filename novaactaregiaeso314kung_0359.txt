described, must be placed in this genus; I am myself inclined to con-
sider Leptocotis mimlanaonis. sTssssmNG, really to be a Streetsia, but
following the rule of not uniting an already established genus or spe-
cies with another without full evidence, I shall for the present content
myself with giving a diagnosis for distinguishing it from the species
of Streetsia.
Beside the typical species Streetsia Challengeri the following
species are to be recorded here, viz: S. porcellus, Omns, S. longi-
ceps, Omns, S. pronoides, C. ssoVA1.1.1us‚ S. Steenstrupi, O. Bo-

vmmms, and S. carinata, n. sp.

the following synoptical table:

A.

The last ural segment is shorter than the telson.

a 1. The lower hind corner of the femur of the sixth

pair of peraeopoda is produced into a long, sharp—
pointed process.

a 2. The lower hind corner of the femur of the sixth

pair of peraeopoda is produced into a short, round-
ed process.

The last ural segment is about as long as the telson.

b l. The under margin of the carpus, and the hind

b2.

margin of the metacarpus of the first pair of
peraeopoda are serrated.

bb 1. The dactylus of the first and second pairs
of peraeopoda is much shorter than half
the metacarpus. The femur of the se-
venth pair is longer than all the follow- ⁷
ing joints together.

bb 2. The dactylus of the first and second pairs
of peraeopoda is longer than half the
metacarpus. The femur of the seventh
pair is muchhshorter than all the follow-
ing joints together.

The under margin of the carpus, and the hind
margin of the metacarpus of the first pair of peraeo-
poda are smooth. The dactylus of the first pair
is not half as long, that of the second pair is
half as long, as the metacarpus. The femur of
the seventh pair is a little longer than all the
following joints together.
