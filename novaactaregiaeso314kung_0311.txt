3. The cheliforrn hand, in which the carpus is not only dilated back-
Α wards, but also produced downwards into
a longer or shorter carpal proce-³¹8, so that
the metacarpus impinges against the from
margin of the carpal process and the dac-
tylus comes into no contact whatever with
the carpus itself. WVhen the hind margin
of the met-acarpns is in contact with the
front margin of the carpal process, the
metacarpus is at an angle of from 450 to
ν ’ almost O ⁰ with the axis of the leg.
Naturally there are many transitions

hands, but for practical reasons I think it best to keep these three
ternis, at least as far as regards the tribe Am phipoda Hyperiidea.

NVhen the lower end of the memmi-pus is dilated so that this
, joint shows an under margin, straight or excavated, and when the hinder
corner of this under margin is produced so that the dactylus, or a por-
tion of the dactylus, impinges against the under margin of the meta-
carpus, I call the double prebensile organ thus formed:

4. A complexely subcheliform hand, (fig. 56), or

5. A complexely cheliforrn hand, (fig. 57) as the carpus is notor
is produced, thus disregarding the fact whether the lo-

wer hindei* corner of the metacarpus is or is not produced.
