J. D. DANA, 16-17, in 1852 placed the Oxycephalids as a sub-
family Ooegsoephalinoe in the family Typltz'dce.

[n 1858 C. SPENCE ΒΑΤΕ, 18, described the new genus Macro-
cephalch, with M. lonyirostris, n. Sp„ later, 20, he himself dropped both names,
finding them synonymous with Rhabdosoma, ADAMs and WHITE, and Rh.
armatum, H. MILNE EDWARDs3 here below it is quoted as synonym for
Xiphocephalus armatus, H. M111NE EDWARDs.

In 1861 the same author, 19, gave some interesting notes on the
young of some Hyperids allied to Ooeyceplzalus; the following year he, ⁴20,
established, in his catalogue of the Amphipoda in the British Museum,
the family Oxycephalidae, with two subfamilies, Synopz'noe and Ooeyce-
phalinoe3 lie described there Oxycephalus piscator, H. MILNE EDWARDS,
O. oceanicus, F. E. Gussnm, and O. tubero illatus, n. sp. this latter was
described from a mutilated specimen but with characteristics sufficient
to show that it is a species of its own, not synonymous with any one of
the previously know-n species3 further Rhabclosoma armatum, H. M1LNE
EDWARDs, and Rh. lez'tei, n. sp. of the former species he gave a new,
enlarged description, adding some good characteristics to those mentio-
ned by H. MlLNE EDWARDs; ofrthe latter species he gave a detailed de-
scription showing beyond doubt that it was a separate species. Unfor-
tunately he did not know both sexes of the two species, but only the
female of the former and the male of the latter. C. CLAUs was proba-
bly misled by this fact to interprete Rh. leitei, SPENCE ΒΑΊῈ, as the
male form of Rlz. armatum, H. MILNE EDWARDs. SPENCE BATE gave also
drawings of all these species.
