80 CARL BovALLms‚ THE OXYCEPHALms.

Gen. 6. Streetsia‚ ΤΗ. ΞΤΕΒΒΙΝΘ, 1888.

The name was given by STEBBING in honour of D:r ΤΗ, H. STREETS, of the
United States' Navy.

Diayn. The lzeacl is very long, narrow⁷ produced into a long, evenly
tapering, sharp-pointed rostrum, Which is open on the under
side. The hind part of the head is more cr less constricted,
but does not form a neck.

The second pair of antennae are hidden under the head, when
folded.

The first pair of perceopoda are subcheliform; the second are
inore or less cheliform. The carpus and metacarpus of the
fifth pair are not dilated.

The last coalesced ural segment is not twice as long as the
first, and more or less elongated.

The inner rami of all the three pairs of uropoda are free,
not coalesced with the correspondiug, peduncles.

The tels-on is triangular, eham-pointed, and more or less
elongated.

Syn. 1888. Streetsia‚ ΤΗ. Srnssssnfflv 39, p. 1603.

The original generic diagnosis of STEBmNG contains some charac-
teristics which, in my opinion, have only specific value, as for instance
those respecting the last five pairs of peraeopoda and the length of the
telson. The diagnosis runs:

»Head not constricted at the base, much longer than the peraeon,
the rostrum very elongate and the eyes still inore 80.

The Gnatlzopods complexy subchelate. The second Peraeopods longer
than the First. lee Foro-tlt Perceopods with the hinder apex of the first
joint acutely produced. The Ffftlz Perceopods with dilated first joint
exceeding in length the other five joints together; the outstretched
limb exceeding in length the first joint of the fourth pair.

lee Uropods with the rami distinct from the pedunoles; the Third
Uropods with peduncles much longer than broad.

lee Telson produced far beyond the uropods, much longer than
the coalesced fifth and sixth segments of the pleon.»
