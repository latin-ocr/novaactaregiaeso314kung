78 CARI, BOVALLms, THE OXYCEPHALIDS.

considerably broader than, that in the preceding pair, and almost as long
as the four following joints together; the upper hind corner is much dilated,
and the apex is produced behind the genu, forming a broadly rounded
process Which reaches to the apex of the genu; the tibia is nearly as
long as the three following joints together; the front margin is fringed
with a row of equal, long, spine-like teeth3 the front margin of the meta-
carpus shows longer and shorter hair-like bristles, not disposed in
regular, come-like groups as in Dor-ycephalus ambobus; the dactylus is a
third part as long as the metacarpus. The seven th pair (Pl. H, fig. 18)
are a fourth ‘part shorter than the femur of the sixth3 the carpus is
somewhat longer than the metacarpns3 the dactylus is not fully half as
long as the metacarpus.

The pleon in the male is a little shorter than the last six per-‹eonal
segments together3 in the female it. is a little shorter than the last five.

The first pair of uropoda (p. 38, fig. 73) reach to the apex of
the last pair, but do not attain the apex of the telson3 the peduncle is
about nine times as long as broad, a little more than twice as long as
the onter ramim, and quite as long as the last coalesced ural segment3
it is finely pectinated along the inner margin, and coarsely serrated
along the lower half of the outer, the outer ramus is elongated, sharp-
pointed, more than four times as long as the inner, coarsely serrated
along the outer margin, and finely pectinated along the inner3 the inner
ramus (p. 39, fig. 77) is lanceolate, serrated along both margins. The
second pair reach to the middle of the inner, ramus of the last pair3
the peduncle is about seven times as long as broad, more than twice as
long as the inner ramus, and armed on the margins as that of the first pair3
both 'rami are elongated and sharp-pointed3 the inner is serrated on both
margins, the outer ramus is serrated on the inner margin and smooth on
the outer. The third pair do not reach to the apex of the telson; the
peduncle is half as long as the inner ramus, which is strongly serrated
along the inner margin and almost smooth on the outer3 the outer ramus
is shorter than the peduncle, almost styliform, serrated on the inner
margin and smooth on the onter. Ι

The telson is elongate-triangular, sharp-pointed, nearly half as
long as the last coalesced ural segment‚ and about three times as long
as it is broad at the base.
