Instead of tracing the history of the genus and the various spe-
cies assigned to it, the most important facts of which are briefly given
above in the historic-al introduction, I only give here a list of anthe spe-
cies adding to ‘them the names which I believe to be their true names,
that is to say those under which they are recorded iu this t-reatise.
