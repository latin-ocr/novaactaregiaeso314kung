Diayn. The body is scarcely compressed, the peraeonal segments are
smooth.

The head is about as long as the peraeon, and has a short rostrum.
The hind part of the head is inore than twice as long as
the rostrum. '

The front margin of the cai-pal process of* the first pair of
pefr‘seopoa'a is as long as, that of the second pair longer
than, the hind margin of the metacarpus, which is strong-
ly pectinated, with long teeth‚ and a few long bordering
bristles; the lower front corner of the carpus does not pro-
trude. The fifth pair are longer than the sixth. The femur
of the sixth pair is pear-shaped⁷ considerably broader than
that of the fifth, and only a little longer than that of the
seventh pair, which is itself about as long as all the follow-
ing joints together.

The latera] parts of the first two pleonal segments are straight
in front and below, while that of the third segmentis round-
ed3 the under margins without moth-like projections. The
hind corner of the first-segment is rounded, that of the second
angular, and that of the third produced⁷ and sharp-pointed.

The last coalesced ura! segment is much longer than the
telson, bnt not twice 38 long.

The tels-on reaches to the-apex of the last pair of uropoda.

Syn. 1887. Oxycephalus pectinatus, C, BovALms 35, p. 36.

Oxycephalus pectinatus is most closely allied to O. [miros-tris,
but differs in the length os the head, in the armature of the first two
pairs of peraeopoda‚ in the comparatively short seventh pair, and in the
1818011 being more than half as long 38 the last ural segment.

The head (Pl. H, fig. 4) in the male is a little longer than all the
peraeonal segments together, in the female a little shorter. The rostrum
is scarcely more than a third part as long as the rest of the head.

The first pair of antennae (p. 25, fig. 19 and 21) 111 1118 male
are comparatively robust3 the first joint of the flagellum is three times as
