130 GARL BOVALIAUS, THE OXYCEPHALms.

middle (p. 30, fig. 47). The epimeral of the seventh pair has the front
corner feebly rounded and the hind part deeply projecting downwards,
almost crescent-shaped, with the sharp-pointed apex directed straight
downwards. On the manner of bearing the eggs and young see above
p. 31 and 43, and also Pl. VII, fig. 20.

The branc-laiac vesicles (p. 30, fig. 46) are like those in Xiphoce-
phalas armatus, and are attached to the second, third, fourth, fifth, and
sixth pairs of peraeopoda in the male as well as in the female.

The peroeopoda. The first pair (Pl. VII, fig. 15) have the carpus
comparatively broader than in the preceding species; the cai-pal process
is broadly triangular3 the hind margin is entirely smooth, without tooth;
the front margin is serrated, and is much longer than the hind margin
of the metacarpus, reaching beyond the apex of the dactylum the hind
portion of the met-acarpus is produced at the lower corner into a sharp-
pointed angle; the dactylus is curved, and is about half as long as the
metacarpus. The second pair (Pl. VH, fig. 16> are much longer than
the first3 the carpal process reaches a little beyond the apex of the
metacarpus, but does not attain the apex of the dactylus. The third
and fourth pairs are similar in shape and equal in length; the femur
is narrower at the base than at the apex; the tibia is longer than
the femur, linear in the male and in the not ovigerous female, but in-
flated, as well as the carpus, in the female which carries more or less
developed eggs. The fifth and sixth pairs are similar in shape and ·
subequal in length, the sixth sometimes being a trifle longer than the
fifth, the femur is longer than in the two preceding pairs, narrow and
linear, about ten or eleven times as long as broad, and a little longer
than the tibia3 the tibia and carpus are inflated in ovigerous females
(p. 42, fig. 85), as I have said above, but linear in the other individuals;
the not inflated carpus and the metacarpus of the sixth pair are armed on
the front margin with peculiar comb-like sets of spines or bristles fixed
on ovate discs (see above p. 35—36 and p. 35, fig. 63—64); the meta-
carpus is longer than the carpus, and the dactylus is more than a third
part as long as the metacarpus. The seventh pair consist ofa single,
evenly rounded, bladder-like joint.

The pleon is carinated3 in the male it is considerably longer than
the peraeon3 in the female it is scarcely longer than the last six peraeonal
segments together. The under margin of the pleonal segments is strongly
convex or rather protruding, the hind corner is produced into a tolerably

long and sharp-pointed process.
