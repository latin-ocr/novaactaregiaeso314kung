OXYCEPHALUS TUBERCULATUS. 63

The lateral parts of the pleonal segments are rounded in front,
beIOW, and behind, and the under margins are without tooth—
like projections.

The last coalesced urat segment is somewhat shorter than the
telson (?).

The telson reaches beyond the apex of the last pair of uropoda.

In addition to the characteristics quoted in the diagnosis, and
which are taken from the description of SpssNcs BA'rE, and with respect
to a few particulars from STREETs work of 1877, Ι cite here some more
details from the same authors:

SPENCE BATE says (1. c. p. 343).

»Antepenultimate pair of pleopoda having the rami short, serrated3
penultimate not so long as the preceding, having the margins of the
rami smooth3 ultimate not reaching to the extremity of the telson,
rami having the margins serratecl. Telson acutely triangular, margins
serrated.»

STREE'rs says( l. c. p. 136).

»Head not quite as long as the first five segments of the thorax,
broad, inferior margin broadly convex;⁴ rostrum more than half the length
of the head, triangular, acute; eyes large, cover-ing the whole of the
latera] surfaces of the head. — -— — The first pair of gnathopoda
shorter than the second, but similar to them in other respects; carpus
produced anteriorly nearly to the apex of the propodos, margins furnished
with a few long setae, not serrated3 propodos subovate; dactylus nearly
half as long as the propodos. The flexible margins of the following
thoracic feet furnished with a few setae, or hairs».
